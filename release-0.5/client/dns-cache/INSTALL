- To install this module you need to install EBox base and bind9.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- Do not run bind9 on startup, this module takes control of bind9:

mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXbind9 /etc/rc2.d/KXXbind9

- Stop bind9 if it's running.
