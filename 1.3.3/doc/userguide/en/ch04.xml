		<title>What the network objects are?</title>

		<para>Network objects are an easy way to give a name
		to a network item, or a group of them. They are used
		to simplify network configuration management, allowing
		you to choose different behaviors for each item or
		group of them with just a descriptive name.</para>

		<para>Network objects can be used, for instance, to
		five a name to an IP or a group of IPs. If the object
		is a group of IPs, instead of defining some rules for
		each IP, every IP inside the object will acquire that
		configuration.</para>

                  You may add as many objects you want. A name must be
                  provided to the object. After that, you may enter
                  into <emphasis><guilabel>members</guilabel></emphasis> field where you
                  may define:

                  <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><guilabel>Name</guilabel>
                    : name assigned to the member.
                    </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><guilabel>IP
                    address</guilabel>
                    : member IP address
                    </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><guilabel>Network
                    mask</guilabel>
                    : network mask, using CIDR notation
                    </para></listitem>
                    <!-- FIXME: poner equivalencias entre notaciÃ³n CIDR y dotted

                    <listitem><para><guilabel>MAC</guilabel>
                    (optional): hardware address -or MAC
                    address- of the network interface
                    corresponding to that IP address.
                    </para></listitem>
                  </itemizedlist>
                </para>
                <para>
                  Editing an object or a member of it is done by
                  clicking the pencil icon in <guilabel>Action</guilabel>
                  field. Likewise the object/member removal is done by
                  clicking on the trash can icon.
