# Class: EBox::CGI::Controller::Composite
#
#      This CGI is the composite controller. That is, it determines
#      what to do after a call to get an action performed.
#
#      It inherits from <EBox::CGI::ClientRawBase>, so the returning
#      HTML just includes what Viewer method returns
#

use EBox::Gettext;

# Constructor: new
#
#       The CGI constructor.
#
# Parameters:
#
#       <EBox::CGI::ClientRawBase::new> the parent parameters
#
#       composite - <EBox::Model::Composite> the composite model to
#       take the action and show it
#
#       action  - String the action to be performed
#
#       - Named parameters
#
# Returns:
#
#       <EBox::CGI::Controller::Composite> - the recently created CGI
