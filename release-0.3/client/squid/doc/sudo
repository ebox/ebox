Sudo is used to execute privileged commands such as iptables, ifup, ifdown, 
rc.d scripts and so on. See /ebox/doc/sudoers.example at the ebox base package
to see a configuration example for a sudoers file.

You should add these commands to your sudoers file to allow this module to work
properly:

	/bin/mv * /etc/squid.conf
	/etc/init.d/squid *
