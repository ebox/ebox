INSTALLATION
------------

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

	Please it is necessary to perform all the steps below
	in strict sequence:
	
	Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.
	
	Copy samba.schema and ebox.schema from directory 'schemas' to
	/etc/ldap/schema .

	Execute 'ebox-init-ldap genconfig' from ebox-usersandgroups

	Restart slapd

		/etc/init.d/slapd restart

	Now you must generate  smb.conf file and  libnss-ldap.conf. 
	Use ebox-samba-ldap in tools:

		ebox-samba-ldap genconfig
	
	Now you must change your /etc/nsswitch.conf file to add
	ldap support:

		passwd:         files ldap
		group:          files ldap
		shadow:         files ldap
	
	Now you  have to update the current ldap database with samba
	objects:

		ebox-samba-ldap update

	You need to create some  directories:

		mkdir -p /home/samba/users
		mkdir /home/samba/groups
		mkdir /home/samba/profiles
		mkdir /home/samba/logon


	Set the samba admin password to your ldap admin password:

		smbpasswd -w YOUR_LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD
	
	Quota support:
	
		Your kernel must be compiled with quota support

		Modify your /etc/fstab to support quotas(usrquota, grpquota) 
		in your mounting point for home directories:
		
		/dev/hda12      /home           ext3    defaults,usrquota,grpquota      
	
		Remount the partition or reboot
		
		quotaon -u "mounting point for home directories"
