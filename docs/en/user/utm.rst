This section will explain different techniques to protect your network
beyond a simple firewall, preventing external attacks,
and detecting possible intrusions into your network services.

An email service without a spam filter is a waste of time and resources.
This section shows different techniques to avoid junk mail (spam) and viruses
in the email service provided by eBox.

Web traffic can also bring problems depending on the sites visited. Therefore,
in this section we explain the integration of the content filtering of the
*HTTP proxy* with an antivirus and several advanced configurations to provide
greater security to the Internet browsing of the users in the network.

We will also explain how to allow the employees outside the office to
securely connect your local network, or how to make connections between
offices by using **virtual private networks**. For that we will define the
bases of the network security.

Finally, it is explained how the intrusion detection system
uses rulesets to match the contents of the traffic packages in order
to detect external attacks. You can get notifications of possible attacks and
analyze the damage they may have caused.
