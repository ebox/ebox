Quality of Service (QoS)
========================

**Quality of Service** (QoS) in computer networks refers to resource
reservation control mechanisms to provide different priorities to
different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a
certain level of performance according to the constraints imposed by
the application. Constraints such as delay in delivery, the *bit*
rate, the probability of packet loss or the variation delay per packet
[#]_ may be determined for various multimedia data stream applications
such as voice or TV over IP. These mechanisms are only applied when
resources are limited (wireless cellular networks) or when there is
congestion in network, otherwise such QoS mechanisms are not required.

.. [#] *jitter* or *Packet Delay Variation* (PDV) is the difference in
       end-to-end delay between selected packets in a flow with any
       lost packets being ignored.

There are several techniques to give quality of service:

Reserving network resources:
  Using *Resource reSerVation Protocol* (RSVP) to request and reserve
  resources in the routers. However, this option has been neglected
  because it does not scale well with Internet growth.

Differentiated services (*DiffServ*):
  In this model, packets are marked according to the type of service
  they need. In response to these marks, routers and switches use
  various queuing strategies to tailor performance to
  requirements. This approach is currently widely accepted.

In addition to these systems, *bandwidth management* mechanisms may be
used to further improve performance such as  **traffic shaping**, **Scheduling
algorithms** o **congestion avoidance**.

Regarding traffic shaping, there are two predominant methods:

*Token bucket*:
  It dictates when traffic can be transmitted, based on the presence
  of *tokens* in the *bucket* (an abstract container that holds
  aggregate network traffic to be transmitted). Each *token* in the
  *bucket* can represent a unit of *bytes* of predetermined size, so
  each time that traffic is transmitted, the *tokens* are removed
  (*cashed in*). When there are no *tokens*, a flow cannot transmit
  its packets. Periodically, *tokens* are added to the *bucket*. Using
  such mechanism, it is allowed to send data in peak burst rate.

*Leaky bucket*:
  Conceptually based on considering a *bucket* with a hole in the
  bottom. If packets arrive, they are placed into the bucket until it
  becomes full, then packets are discarded. Packets are sent at a
  *constant rate*, which is equivalent to the size of the hole in the
  bucket.

QoS configuration in eBox
=========================

eBox uses Linux kernel features [#]_ to shape traffic using *token bucket*
mechanisms that allow to assign a limited rate, a guaranteed rate and a
priority to certain types of data flows through the
:menuselection:`Traffic Shaping --> Rules` menu.

.. [#] Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control http://lartc.org

In order to perform traffic shaping, it is required to have, at least,
an internal network interface and an external one. You need, at least,
one configured *gateway* as well.  And you have also to set your bandwidth
information in :menuselection:`Traffic Shaping --> Interface
Rates`. Set the upload and download rate that provide the router that
is connected to every external interface. The shaping rules are
specific for each interface and they may be selected for those
external network interfaces with assigned upload rate and all internal
ones.

.. FIXME: New shot with interface rates page

If the external network interface is shaped, then you are limiting
eBox output traffic to the Internet. If, however, you shape an
internal network interface, then the eBox output to internal networks
is limited. The maximum output and input rates are given by the
configuration in :menuselection:`Traffic Shaping --> Interface Rates`.
As it can be seen, shaping input traffic is not possible directly,
that is because input traffic is not predictable nor controllable in
almost any way. There are specific techniques from various protocols
to handle the incoming traffic, for instance, TCP by artificially
adjusting the window size as well as controlling the rate of
acknowledgements (ACK) segments being returned to the sender.

Each network interface has a rule table to give
:guilabel:`priority` (0: highest priority, 7: lowest priority),
:guilabel:`guaranteed rate` and/or :guilabel:`limited rate`. These
rules apply to traffic bound to a :guilabel:`service`,
a :guilabel:`source` and/or a :guilabel:`destination`.

   Traffic shaping rules

Practise example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set up a rule to shape incoming HTTP traffic by limiting it to 20KB/s. Check if
it works properly.

#. **Action:**
   Add a gateway in :menuselection:`Network --> Gateways` to
   your external network interface.

   Effect:
     The :guilabel:`Save changes` button is enabled. The gateway list
     displays a single gateway.

#. **Action:**
   Save the changes.

   Effect:
     eBox displays the progress while the changes are being applied. Once this is
     complete, it informs the user.

#. **Action:**
   Enter :menuselection:`Services` and add a new external service called HTTP
   with TCP protocol and destination port 80.

   Effect:
     eBox shows a list with all the services where the new service is
     displayed too.

#. **Action:**
   Enter :menuselection:`Traffic Shaping --> Rules`. Select the internal
   interface from the interface list and, using :guilabel:`Add new`, set a new
   rule with the following details:

   :Enabled:         Yes
   :Service:         Port-based service / HTTP
   :Source:          any
   :Destination:     any
   :Priority:        7
   :Guaranteed rate: 0 Kb/s
   :Limited rate:    160 Kb/s

   Press the :guilabel:`Add` button.

   Effect:
     eBox displays a table with the new traffic shaping rule.

#. **Action:**
   Start downloading a huge file, which is reachable from the Internet
   (for example, a Ubuntu ISO image) from a host within your **LAN**
   (not eBox itself) using the **wget** command.

   Effect:
     The download rate is stable around 20 KB/s (160 Kbit/s).
