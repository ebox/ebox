The **electronic mail** service is a store and forward method [#]_
to compose, send, store and receive messages over electronic
communication systems.

.. [#] **Store and forward**: Telecommunication technique in which 
       information is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept
       and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another
       intermediate station.

How electronic mail works through the Internet
==============================================

   Diagram where Alice sends an email to Bob

The diagram depicts a typical event sequence that takes place when
Alice writes a message to Bob using her *Mail User Agent* (MUA).

1. Her MUA formats the message in email format and uses the
   *Simple Mail Transfer Protocol* (SMTP) to send the message to the
   local *Mail Transfer Agent* (MTA).
2. The MTA looks at the destination address provided in the SMTP (not
   from the message header), in this case bob@b.org, and resolves a
   domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the
   destination mail exchanger server (**MX** record that was explained
   in the DNS section).
3. **smtp.a.org** sends the message to **mx.b.org** using SMTP, which
   delivers it to the mailbox of the user **bob**.
4. Bob receives the message through his MUA, which picks up the
   message using *Pop Office Protocol* (POP3).

There are many alternative possibilities and complications to the
previous email system sequence. For instance, Bob may pick up his
email in many ways, for example using the *Internet Message Access
Protocol* (IMAP), by logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or
by using a **Webmail** service.

The sending and reception of emails between mail servers is done through SMTP
but the users pick up their email using POP3, IMAP or their secure versions
(POP3S and IMAPS). Using these protocols
provides interoperability among different servers and email clients. There
are also proprietary protocols such as the ones used by *Microsoft Exchange* 
and *IBM Lotus Notes*.

POP3 and IMAP
-------------

The POP3 design to retrieve email messages is useful for slow connections,
allowing users to pick up all their email all at once to see and
manage it without being connected. These messages are usually removed
from the user mailbox in the server, although most MUAs allow to keep them
on the server.

The more modern IMAP, allows to work on-line or offline as well as
to explicitly manage server stored messages. Additionally, it allows
simultaneous access by multiple clients to the same mailbox or partial fetches
from MIME messages among other advantages. However, it is a quite complicated
protocol with more server work load than POP3, which puts most of the load on
the client side. The main advantages over POP3 are:

- Connected and disconnected modes of operation.
- Multiple clients simultaneously connected to the same mailbox.
- Access to MIME message parts and partial fetch.
- Message state information using *flags* (read, removed, replied, ...).
- Multiple mailboxes on the server (usually presented to the user as
  folders) allowing to make some of them public.
- Server-side searches
- Built-in extension mechanism

Both POP3 and IMAP have secure versions, called respectively POP3S and
IMAPS. The difference with the normal version is that they use TLS encryption so
the content of the messages cannot be sniffed.


SMTP/POP3-IMAP4 server configuration with eBox
==============================================

Setting up an email system service requires to configure an MTA to send
and receive emails as well as IMAP and/or POP3 servers to allow users
to retrieve their mails.

To send and receive emails Postfix [#f1]_ acts as SMTP server. The email
retrieval service (POP3, IMAP4) is provided by Dovecot [#f2]_. Both
servers support secure communication using SSL.

Receiving and relaying mail
============================

To understand the configuration a distinction must be made between receiving mail
and relaying mail.

Reception is when the server accepts mail which recipient is
an account that belongs to any of he virtual mail domains
managed by the server. Mail can be received from any client which will be able
to connect to the server.

In the other hand, relay is when the recipient of the mail doesn't belong 
to any of the
managed virtual mail domains, thus requiring forwarding it to other server.
Mail relay is restricted, otherwise spammers could use the server to
send spam over the Internet. 

eBox allows mail relay in two cases:

 * an authenticated user
 * a source address that belongs to a network object which has a **allowed relay** policy


General configuration
---------------------

Through :menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Authentication ` you
can manage the authentication options. The following options are
available:

:guilabel:`TLS for SMTP server`: 
   Forces to the clients connecting to the mail server to use TLS encryption,
   thus avoiding eavesdroppers.
:guilabel:`Require authentication`: 
   This  setting enables the use of authentication. To authenticate a user must
   use his email address and his password, authenticated users can relay mail
   through the server. An account alias cannot be used to authenticate.


.. image:: images/mail/01-general.png

In the :menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Mail server options` section you
can access the general settings.  The following settings can be configured:


:guilabel:`Smarthost to send mail`:
  Domain name or IP address of the smarthost. You could also specify a port
  appending the text ':[port_number ]'
  after the address. The default port is the standard SMTP port, 25.

  If this option is used eBox will not send its messages directly but each received email will be forwarded to the *smarthost* without
  keeping a copy. In this case, eBox would be an intermediary between the
  user who sends the email and the server which is the real message
  sender. 
:guilabel:`Smarthost authentication`:
  Whether the smarthost requires authentication using
  user and password or not.
:guilabel:`Server mailname`: 
  This sets the visible mail name of the system, it will be used by the mail
  server as the local address of the system. 
:guilabel:`Postmaster address`: 
  The postmaster address by default is aliased to the root user but it could be
  setted to any account, belonging to the managed virtual mail domains or not. 

  This account is intended to be a standard way to reach the administrator of
  the mail server. 
  Automatically-generated notification mails will typically use **postmaster** as
  reply address.
:guilabel:`Maximum mailbox size allowed`: 
  In this option you could indicate a
  maximum size in Mb for any user mailboxes. All mail which surpasses the limit
  will be rejected and the sender will be emailed a notification. This setting
  could be overridden for any user in the :menuselection:`Users -> Edit User` page.
:guilabel:`Maximum message size accepted`:
  Indicates, if necessary, the maximum message size accepted by the
  smarthost in MB. This is enforced regardless of any mailbox size limit.
:guilabel:`Expiration period for deleted mails`: 
  if you enable this option mail in the users' trash folder will be deleted when
  their dates passes the day limit.
:guilabel:`Expiration period for spam mails`: 
   this work the same than the previous option but it affects to the users' spam folder.

In order to configure the mail retrieval services go to
the :guilabel:`Mail retrieval services` section. There eBox may be
configured as POP3 and/or IMAP server, their secure versions POP3S and IMAPS are
available too.
Also the retrieve email for external accounts and ManageSieve services could be
enabled in this section, we will discuss those services in their own section.

In addition to this, eBox may be configured to relay mail without authentication
from some network addresses. To
do so, you can add relay policies for network objects through
:menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Relay policy for network objects`.
The policies are based on the source mail server IP address. If the relay is
allowed from a object, then each object member may relay emails through eBox.

.. image:: images/mail/02-relay.png

.. warning::
   Be careful when using an *Open Relay* policy, i.e., forwarding
   email from everywhere, since your mail server will probably
   become a *spam* source.

Finally, the mail server may be configured to use a content filter for
their messages [#]_. To do so, the filter server must receive the
message from a fixed port and send the result back to another fixed port
where the mail server is bound to listen the response. Through
:menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Mail filter options`, you may
choose a custom server or eBox as mail filter.

.. [#] In  :ref:`mailfilter-sec-ref` section this topic is explained in depth.

Email account creation through virtual domains
-----------------------------------------------

In order to set up an email account with a mailbox, a virtual domain and
a user are required. From :menuselection:`Mail --> Virtual Mail Domains`,
you may create as many virtual domains as you want. They provide the
*domain name* for email accounts for eBox users. Moreover, it is
possible to set *aliases* for a virtual domain. It does not make any difference
to send an email to one virtual domain or any of their aliases.

.. image:: images/mail/mail-vdomains.png
   :align: center

In order to set up email accounts, you have to follow the same rules than
when configuring file sharing. From
:menuselection:`Users and Groups --> Users --> Edit Users --> Create mail account`.
There, you select the main virtual domain for the user. If you want to
assign to the user more than a single email address, you can use aliases.
Behind the scenes, the email messages are kept just once in a mailbox.
However is not possible to use the alias to authenticate, you have always to use
the real account.

Note that you can decide whether an email account should be created by
default when a new user is added or not. You can change this behaviour in
:menuselection:`Users and Groups --> Default User Template --> Mail Account`.

.. image:: images/mail/03-user.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 80

Likewise, you may set up *aliases* for user groups. Messages received
by these aliases are sent to every user of the group which has email account.  Group aliases are
created through
:menuselection:`Groups --> Edit Group --> Create alias mail account to
group`. The group aliases are only available when at least one user of the
group has a email account.

You too can define alias to external accounts. The mail sent to
an  alias will be forwarded to the external account. This kind of aliases are
set on a virtual domain basis and
does not require any email account and could be set in :menuselection:`Mail -->
Virtual Domains --> External accounts aliases `.



Queue Management
----------------

From :menuselection:`Mail --> Queue Management`, you may see those
email messages that haven't already been delivered. All
the information about the messages is displayed. The allowed actions to perform
are:
deletion, content viewing or send retrying (*re-queuing* the
message again). There are also two buttons to delete or requeue all messages in queue.

.. image:: images/mail/04-queue.png
   :align: center


Mail retrieval from external accounts
-------------------------------------

eBox could configured to retrieve email from external accounts and deliver it to
the user's mailboxes. To allow this, in :guilabel:`Retrieval services` you had to
enable this service. Once is enabled the users will have their mail fetched from
their external accounts and delivered to their internal account's mailbox. Each user can
configure its external accounts through the user corner. The user must have a
email account to be able to do this. The external servers are pooled
periodically so email retrieval is not instantaneous.


For retrieving external emails, eBox uses  Fetchmail [#f3]_ .

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f3] **Fetchmail** The Fetchmail Home Page http://fetchmail.berlios.de/ .


Sieve scripts and ManageSieve protocol
---------------------------------------
The Sieve language [#f4]_  allows the user to control how his mail is delivered, so is
possible to classify it in IMAP folders, forward it or use a vacation message
among other things.

The ManageSieve is a network protocol that allows to the users to easily manage
their Sieve scripts. To be able to use ManageSieve, it is needed that the email
client could understand the protocol. [#f5]_

To enable ManageSieve in eBox you have to turn on the service in :menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Mail server
options -> Retrieval services` and it could be used by all the users with email
account. Additionally if ManageSieve is enabled and the webmail module in use, a
management interface for Sieve scripts will be available in the webmail.

The ManageSieve authentication is done with the email account of the user and
its password.

Sieve scripts of an account are executed regardless whether the ManageSieve
protocols is enabled or not.

Email client configuration
--------------------------
Unless the are using email only through  the webmail or the egroupware module, users would have
to configure their email clients to use eBox's mail server. The values of the
required parameters would depend on the exact configuration of the module.

Please note that different email clients could use other names for this
parameters, so due to the great number of clients available this section is orientative.

SMTP parameters
===============
 * SMTP server: here you must enter the address of your eBox server. It could be
   either an IP address or a domain name.
 * SMTP port: 25, if you are using TLS you could instead use the port 465.
 * Secure connection: You must select `TLS` if you have enabled :guilabel:`TLS
   for SMTP server:`, otherwise select `none`. If you are using TLS please read the warning below about SSL/TLS
 * SMTP username: you must use this if you have enabled :guilabel:`Require
   authentication`. Use as username the full email address of the user, don't
   use the username neither one of his mail aliases. 
 * SMTP password: is the same that the user password

POP3 parameters
================
You can only use POP3 settings when POP3 or POP3S services are enabled in eBox.
 * POP3 server: enter your eBox address like in the SMTP server
 * POP3 port: 110, 995 if you are using POPS
 * Secure connection: select 'SSL' if you are using POP3S, otherwise
   `none`. If you are using POP3S please read the warning below about SSL/TLS
 * POP3 username: full email address
 * POP3 password: user's password.


IMAP parameters
===============
IMAP configuration could be only used if either IMAP or IMAPS services are
enabled. As you will see the parameters are almost identical to POP3 parameters.

 * IMAP server: enter your eBox address like in the SMTP server
 * IMAP port: 443, 993 if you are using IMAPS
 * Secure connection: select `SSL` if you are using IMAPS, otherwise
   `none`. If you are using IMAPS please read the warning below about SSL/TLS
 * IMAP username: full email address
 * IMAP password: user's password.

.. warning::

 In  client implementations is some confusion about the use of
 SSL and TLS protocols. Some clients use `SSL` to mean that they will try to
 connect with `TLS`, others use `TLS` as means to say that they will try to
 connect to the secure service through a port used normally by the non-secure
 version of the protocol.. In fact in some clients
 you will need to try both `SSL` and `TLS` modes to find which one will work.

 You have more information about this issue in this page
 http://wiki.dovecot.org/SSL , from the dovecot's wiki.



ManageSieve client parameters
=============================
To connect to ManageSieve, you will need the following parameters:
 * Sieve server: the same than your IMAP or POP server.
 * Port: 4190. Be warned that some applications use, mistakenly, the port 2000
   as default for ManageSieve.
 * Secure connection: true
 * Username: full mail address
 * Password: user's password. Some clients allows you to select the same
   authentication than your IMAP or POP3 account if this is allowed, select it.


Catch-all account
-----------------

A catch-all account is an account that receives a copy of all the mail sent and
received by a mail domain. eBox allows define a catch-all account for each of the
virtual domains; to define it you must go to :menuselection:`Mail --> Virtual
Mail Domains` and then click in the :guilabel:`Settings` cell. 

All the messages sent and received by the domain will be emailed as blind
carbon copy to the defined address. If the mail to the catch-all address bounces it will be returned to the sender.

Practice example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set up a virtual domain for the mail service. Create a user account
and a mail account within the domain for that user. Configure the
*relay* policy to send email messages. Send a test email message
with the new account to an external mail account.

#. **Action:**
   Log into eBox, access :menuselection:`Module status` and enable
   **Mail** by checking its checkbox in the :guilabel:`Status` column.
   Enable **Network** and **Users and Groups** first if they
   are not already enabled.

   Effect:
     eBox requests permission to overwrite certain files.

#. **Action:**
   Read the changes of each of the files to be modified and
   grant eBox permission to overwrite them.

   Effect:
     The :guilabel:`Save changes` button has been enabled.

#. **Action:**
   Go to :menuselection:`Mail --> Virtual Mail Domains` and click
   :guilabel:`Add new` to create a new domain. Enter the name in
   the appropriate field.

   Effect:
     eBox notifies you that you must save changes to use this virtual
     domain.

#. **Action:**
   Save the changes.

   Effect:
     eBox displays the progress while the changes are being applied. Once this is
     completed, you will be notified.

     Now you may use the newly created virtual mail domain.

#. **Action:**
   Enter :menuselection:`Users and Groups --> Users --> Add User`,
   fill up the user data and click the :guilabel:`Create and Edit` button.

   Effect:
     The user is added immediately without saving changes. The edition
     screen is displayed for the newly created user.

#. **Action:**

     (This action is only required if you have disable the automatic creation
     of email accounts in `Users and Groups --> Default User Template
      --> Mail Account`). Introduce a name for the user mail account in
     :guilabel:`Create mail account` and create it.

   Effect:
     The account has been added immediately and options to delete it
     or add *aliases* for it are shown.

#. **Action:**
   Enter the :menuselection:`Object --> Add new` menu. Fill in a name for
   the object and press :guilabel:`Add`. Click on :guilabel:`Members`
   in the created object. Fill in again a name for the member and write
   the host IP address where the mail will be sent from.

   Effect:
     The object has been added temporarily and you may use it in other
     eBox sections, but it is not persistent until you save changes.

#. **Action:**
   Enter :menuselection:`Mail --> General --> Relay policy for network
   objects`. Select the previously created object making sure
   :guilabel:`Allow relay` is checked and add it.

   Effect:
     The :guilabel:`Save changes` button has been enabled.

#. **Action:**
   Save the changes

   Effect:
     A relay policy for that object has been added, which makes
     possible from that object to send e-mails to the outside.

#. **Action:**
   Configure a selected MUA in order to use eBox as SMTP server and
   send a test email message from this new account to an external
   one.

   Effect:
     After a brief period you should receive the message in your
     external account mailbox.

#. **Action:**
   Verify using the mail server log file `/var/log/mail.log`
   that the email message was delivered correctly.
