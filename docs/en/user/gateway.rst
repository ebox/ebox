This section considers the main function of eBox as a
gateway. eBox Gateway can make your network more reliable,
optimized for your bandwidth and help you control whatever enters
your network.

This section includes a chapter that focuses on the functionality
of the eBox firewall module, which enables you to manage
rules for the incoming and outgoing traffic of your internal network.

The firewall is not configured directly, but is supported
by another two modules that provide easier network object and
service management, as described in the first part of the
section.

Load balancing can be applied for Internet access, along with
different rules depending on the outgoing traffic.
Furthermore, this section explains
traffic shaping, which is used to ensure critical applications are
served correctly and to even limit any applications
generating a lot of network traffic.

Finally, there is an introduction to the HTTP *proxy* service offered by eBox.
This service allows or denies access from the internal network to the
WWW using different filtering rules, including content-based ones.
