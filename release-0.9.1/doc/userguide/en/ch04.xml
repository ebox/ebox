		<title>What the network objects are?</title>

		<para>Network objects are an easy way to give a name
		to a network item, or a group of them. They are used
		to simplify network configuration management, allowing
		you to choose different behaviors for each item or
		group of them with just a descriptive name.</para>

		<para>Network objects can be used, for instance, to
		five a name to an IP or a group of IPs. If the object
		is a group of IPs, instead of defining some rules for
		each IP, every IP inside the object will acquire that
		configuration.</para>
