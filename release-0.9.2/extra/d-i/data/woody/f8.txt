0fGETTING HELP07

If you can't install the system, don't despair! The Debian team is ready to 
help you! We are especially interested in hearing about installation problems,
because in general they don't happen to only 0fone07 person. We've either already
heard about your particular problem and can dispense a quick fix, or we would
like to hear about it and work through it with you, and the next user who
comes up with the same problem will profit from your experience!

If you encounter a problem it will fall into one of two areas: the
base system installation, which ends when you start selecting packages
to install; or the installation of packages from the Debian distribution.

Problems with installation of the base system should be addressed to
the Debian Boot Team at 0fdebian-boot@lists.debian.org07.  Problems
installing packages should be directed to 0fdebian-user@lists.debian.org07.
In either case your message should contain a detailed explanation of
your problem, including the text of any system error messages that you
think might be relevant to the problem.  Press function key <09F907> for
more detailed information about these and other Debian e-mail lists.

Press <09ENTER07> or type boot method, arguments, and <09ENTER07> to boot.
Press function key <09F107> for the help index.
