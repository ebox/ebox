# This is a external tool to set/get user quotas. It's a separated script
# as we use the libquota-perl module. In order to use an API that must be run
# as root and not as ebox user
#
# It's meant to be run by eBox.
#
# Parameters are:
#
# -q uid  | -s uid quota
#
# -q: query
# -s: set
# uid: user uid
# quota: quota size in MB
