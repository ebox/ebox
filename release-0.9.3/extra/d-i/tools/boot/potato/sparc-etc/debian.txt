This is the Debian Install CD. Keep it once you have installed your
system, as you can boot from it to repair the system on your hard disk if
that ever becomes necessary.

In order to proceed, you must tell the SILO bootloader the CDROM type. Press
either 'I' (for IDE CDROM drives) or 'S' (for SCSI CDROM drives) below. If
neither of these works, then you will need to type in the full name of the
actual device. Pressing 'O' will give you more info on device naming.

WARNING: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
  proceeding. The installation procedure can completely and irreversibly
  erase them! If you haven't made backups yet, remove the rescue CD from
  the drive and press L1-A to get back to the OpenBoot prompt.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted
by applicable law.

[ S - SCSI ]  [ I - IDE ]  [ O - OTHER ] -- This CD uses Linux 2.2.15
