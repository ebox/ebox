		<para>eBox is based on a few software packages, which are used for
		several purposes:</para>

		<variablelist>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>Linux 2.6</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>eBox relies on some features provided by the kernel, some
					are available only on the 2.6 series. Among these features
					are netfilter (for the firewall), 802.1q (for VLANs) and
					ipsec.</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>perl and mod_perl</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>All eBox modules are implemented in Perl, the web interface
					runs under mod_perl for performance reasons.</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>Mason</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>Mason is a templating system for Perl, it is used to
					generate HTML for the web based user interface and to generate
					configuration files.</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>apache</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>The web interface is served by apache</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>gconf</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>eBox stores its configuration using gconf2 and its Perl
					library bindings.</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>sudo</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>Apache runs as an unprivileged user, all eBox modules use
					sudo to execute commands that need to be run as root.</para>

				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>Debian</term>
				<listitem>

					<para>eBox has been developed on top of Debian, no support is
					provided for other Linux distributions as there are some debianisms
					in some of the modules. Porting to other Linux distributions should
					be quite easy, and porting to other Unix like operating systems such
					as OpenBSD would take a little more work but it should still be
					doable, and worth it.</para>
