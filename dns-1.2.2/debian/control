Description: eBox - DNS server
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds a DNS server to eBox, allowing faster name resolution and
 local domains
