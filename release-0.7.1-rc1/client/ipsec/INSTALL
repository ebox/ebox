- To install this module you need to install eBox base, openswan, and an IPSec
  enabled linux kernel.

- Once all dependencies are satisfied, type:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect eBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- You should not run openswan automatically on startup, this module will start
  it whenever it's needed:

  mv /etc/rcX.d/SXXipsec /etc/rcX.d/KXXipsec

  (replace the X's with the correct numbers)
