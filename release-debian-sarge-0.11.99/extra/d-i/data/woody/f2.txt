0fPREREQUISITES FOR INSTALLING THIS SYSTEM07

You must have at least twelve megabytes of RAM and swap space, or 14MB
if not using swap; there is no low memory boot disk any longer.

You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 64 megabytes and swap space to install the base system.
You'll need more disk space to install additional packages, depending
on what you wish to do with your new Debian system.

See the Installation Manual or the FAQ for more information; both
documents are located in the /doc directory on this CD-ROM.

They are also available at the Debian web site, http://www.debian.org/
