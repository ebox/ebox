0fBOOT METHODS07

The Rescue disk can be used for system recovery as well as for installation.
The 0frescue07 method will mount an existing root partition, while the other
methods will give you a small, standalone root system.

0fAvailable boot methods:07
0flinux07 or 0fidepci07
  Start the installation -- this is the default.
0fbf2407
  Start the installation with a Linux 2.4 kernel.
0fcompact07
  Start the installation with a kernel including PCI SCSI and IDE drivers.
0fvanilla07
  Start the installation with a kernel including many drivers for
  older hardware (such as systems with ISA-based hardware).
0frescue07
  Boot and mount any root filesystem. The root filesystem must be given at
  the prompt, so e.g., type 0frescue root=/dev/hda107.  (You can also use
  0frescbf2407, 0fresccomp07, or 0frescvanl07.)

Press <09ENTER07> or type boot method, arguments, and <09ENTER07> to boot.
