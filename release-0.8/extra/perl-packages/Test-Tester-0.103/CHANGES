0.103

Default to checking depth (check against 1 if none specified). This means
that by default we are checking that the line number/file in failure
messages will be correct.

0.102

Fixed a problem due to subroutine argument aliasing which meant the
delegate object could be replaced by the real Test::Builder object.

Test::Tester must be loaded before Test::Builder. Check for this and warn if
it's not true.

0.101

Added colourisation support.

0.10

Automatically add \n to the expected diagnostics if it's not already there,
because Test::Builder::diag does the same. Thanks to James FitzGibbon for
the suggestion.

Now it's much easier to spot trailing spaces in diagnostics and also
possible to escape all "tricky" characters to make them easy to
troubleshoot.

The depth calculation would die if it couldn't find the correct things in
the call stack. This seemed like a good idea but it breaks tests which are
triggered in signal handlers. So now the calculation will fail silently.

Using local rather than set/unset for the delegator so that if something
dies, we will drop back to the correct test object.

check_test was getting the Level wrong

Made it all very nice so that don't have to worry about providing capture
objects or any of that messiness. Things are automatically captured once
you're inside one of Test::Tester's testing routines.

Added depth to allow testing $Test::Builder::Level.

Updated the POD a bit.

0.07

Spellchecked the POD

0.06

Allow getting current_test but still die if someone tries to set it. Needed
for testing Test::Warn::None

0.05

Added string length length to the diags diags

Corrected level problem cmp_results

0.04

Got rid of undef warning when no name supplied

got rid of unneeded result counting in hceck_test

0.03

Can now capture test output in a veriety of ways, although at the moment I'm
only including one way as I think the other way is quite sucky.

added capturing of skip, and todo_skip

big changes resulting in better handling of everything

0.02

made the diag comparison output nicer

0.01

First release
