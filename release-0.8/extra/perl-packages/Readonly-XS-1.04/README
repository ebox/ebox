Readonly/XS version 1.04
========================

This is a companion module to Readonly.pm.  You do not use
Readonly::XS directly.  Instead, once it is installed, Readonly.pm
will detect this and will use it for creating read-only scalars.  This
results in a significant speed improvement.  This does not speed up
read-only arrays or hashes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

None, although it's useless without Readonly.pm.
