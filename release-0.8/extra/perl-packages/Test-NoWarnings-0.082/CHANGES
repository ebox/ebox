Test::Tester now checks depth by default but depth cannot work with tests in
END blocks so we need to account for this.

0.081

Use the new easier Test::Tester way of doing things.

0.08

Fixed one of the test scripts. $T::B::Level was wrong, with older TB's it
didn't matter but it does now.

Carp.pm changed slightly in perl5.8.5. It used to behave like warn in that
it didn't put "at line blah" at the end of a message that had a \n, even
when it was supposed to be doing a full stack trace. Now it does (which is
probably a good since the stack trace was missing the first frame). The
tests now check Carp's version number.

0.06

Forget to include the LGPL

0.05

for Carp on 5.6.1 we now have to fiddle with CarpLevel

0.04

Carp on 5.6.1 doesn't export longmess, so we have to use a fully qualified
call to Carp::longmess()

0.03

require Test::NoWarnings will not turn on the automatic test at the end.
This is to stop tests running when MakeMaker is checking the version.
