#
#   A package for handling version information.  What?  That's right.  Although it should be easy and obvious, version numbers
#   need to be dealt with in a variety of formats, plus there's compatibility with older releases which handled it differently.  I
#   wanted to centralize the code after it started getting complicated.  So there ya go.

#
#   About: Format
#
#   Version numbers are represented as major.minor.  Major is from 0 to 255, and minor can have one or two digits.  Minor is
#   interpreted as a decimal, so 1.25 is less than 1.3.

# Group: Implementation

#
#   About: String Format
#
#   String versions are normally in the common major.minor format, with the exception of "1".
#
#   If the string is "1" and not "1.0", it's represents releases 0.85 through 0.91, since those had a separate version number for data
#   files.  We switched to using the app version number in 0.95.  This issue does not apply to binary data files since they came
#   after 0.95.
#
#   Text files with "1" as the version will be interpreted as 0.91, since this should not cause compatibility problems.  The only
#   file format changes between 0.85 and 0.91 were to <PreviousMenuState.nd>, which didn't exist in 0.85 and didn't change
#   between 0.9 and 0.91, and <Menu.txt>, which only changed in 0.9 to add index entries.
#

#
#   About: Integer Format
#
#   <VersionInts> are 16-bit unsigned values.  The major version is the high-order byte, and the minor the low-order byte.
#   The minor is always stored with two decimals, so 0.9 would be stored as 0 and 90.
#

#
#   About: Binary File Format
#
#   In binary files, versions are two 8-bit unsigned values, appearing major then minor.  The minor is always stored with two
#   decimals, so 0.9 would be stored as 0 and 90.  It's in the <Integer Format> if interpreted as a _big-endian_ 16-bit value.
#

#
#   About: Text File Format
#
#   In text files, versions are the <String Format> followed by a native line break.
