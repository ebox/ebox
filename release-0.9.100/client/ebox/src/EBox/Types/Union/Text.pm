# Class: EBox::Types::Union::Text
#
#       This type is a specialized version of text to be used at
#       <EBox::Types::Union> type. Its meaning is the option which it
#       is left when the remainder options are not selected.
#
#       For example, a type representing a source as an union of an
#       object or an IP address can be as well represented as any as a
#       value determining that you are selected the whole selection
#       space.
