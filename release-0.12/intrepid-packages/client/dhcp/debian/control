Description: eBox - DHCP server module
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds a DHCP server to your eBox installation, allowing your
 network clients to get network configuration automatically.
