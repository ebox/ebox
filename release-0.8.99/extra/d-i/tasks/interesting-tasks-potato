/*
   This file lists task packages from potato that can be useful to many
   people without taking up too much space on the first CD.
   The first CD is meant to be as useful as possible for "normal" users
   of the type that only develop in C/C++ (if at all), so tasks that
   are too "advanced" are not listed here.
   Anyone installing a heavy server or the like is supposed to have the
   money and/or bandwidth to buy/download the complete distribution.
