0fSPECIAL BOOT ARGUMENTS - OVERVIEW07

On a few systems, you may need to specify a parameter at the 0fboot:07
prompt in order to boot the system. For example, Linux may not be able
to "autodetect" your hardware, and you will need to explicitly specify
its location or type for it to be recognized. The table below
indicates whether you need a parameter. If you do, enter the 0fboot
method07 followed by the parameter from the table. For example, if your
3.5 inch floppy drive is your second drive, and your first drive is a
5.25 inch one, you would type "0flinux root=/dev/fd107" at the 0fboot:07
prompt. Some of the arguments require numerical parameters which are 
shown in 0bcyan07. By default, these are interpreted as decimal. If you use
hex numbers you have to add a 0x prefix (e.g., 0x300).
