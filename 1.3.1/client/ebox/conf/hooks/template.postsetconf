# This is a sample postsetconf script.

# postsetconf scripts are run after the configuration for a given module is
# written. The module will check if an executable file called
# <module>.presetconf exists in /etc/ebox/hooks and will try to run it

# Copy this file or create a script with the appropriate name if you want
# to run some customization script after a module writes its configuration
