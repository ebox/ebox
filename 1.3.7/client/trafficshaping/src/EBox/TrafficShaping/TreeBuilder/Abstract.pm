#       TreeBuilder::Abstract is an abstract class.  It is an
#       abstract interface to create parts of a tree of qdisc and
#       classes for traffic control. It is using a Builder design
#       pattern.

# Method: _init
#
#       Initilization done by all subclasses in constructor
#
# Parameters:
#
#       interface - interface where the builder is attached
#
# Exceptions:
#
#       <EBox::Exceptions::MissingArgument> - throw if any argument is
#       missing

# Method: buildRoot
#
#         Build base for a queue discipline
#
# Parameters:
#
#         defaultClass - default class where all unknown traffic is
#         sent
#
# Returns:
#
#         <Tree> - the tree built

# Returns:
