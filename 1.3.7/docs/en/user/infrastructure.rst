This section explains several of the services to manage and
optimize internal traffic and the infrastructure of your local network,
including domain management, automatic network configuration in network
clients, publication of internal Web sites and
time synchronization using the Internet. The configuration of these
services requires great efforts, although they
are easier to configure with eBox.

The DHCP service is widely used to automatically
configure different network parameters, such as the
IP address of a host or the gateway to be used
for Internet access.

The DNS service provides access to services and hosts using
names instead of IP addresses, which are more difficult to
memorize.

Many businesses use *Web* applications to which only internal
access is available.
