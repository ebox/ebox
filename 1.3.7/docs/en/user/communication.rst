In this section we will see the different communication methods for
sharing information that are centralized in eBox and are all accessible
using the same username and password.

First, the mail service is explained. It allows a quick and easy integration
with the preferred mail client of the users of the network, offering also
the latest techniques available to prevent spam.

Second, the instant messaging service through the Jabber / XMPP protocol.
It provides an internal IM service without having to rely on external companies
or an Internet connection. It also offers conference rooms and can be used with any of the many clients available. It allows faster communication in the cases
where the mail is not enough.

Finally, we will see an introduction to voice over IP, which enables each
person to have an extension to make calls or participate in conferences
easily. Additionally, with an external provider, eBox can be
configured to connect to the traditional telephone network.
