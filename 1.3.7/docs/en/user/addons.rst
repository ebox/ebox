The target of eBox is not only the configuration of the integrated
network services. It also offers a number of features that
facilitate and make more efficient the administration of eBox itself. This
feature set is what we call the eBox **core**.

Backups to restore a previous state, logs
of services to find out what happened and when, notifications
for certain events or incidents, monitoring of the machine
or security updates of the software are issues that
will be explained in this section.
