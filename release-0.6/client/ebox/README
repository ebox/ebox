Writing tests
-------------

1.- Create a test module named EBox::Test:YourModule. Put it in src/EBox/Test

2.- The test module should import Test::Unit::Procedural, which will provide
with the assert() function.

3.- If your module has a set_up() function, it will be called before running the
tests. Initialization code should go there.

5.- The tear_down() function will be run after the tests are run.

6.- All functions in the module whose name starts with "test" are individual
tests that will be run.

7.- Add your module name to the array in common/lib/Test.pm, which contains the
names of all test modules.

8.- Add your test to src/EBox/Makefile.am

9.- Done, all the tests in your module will be run when you run ebox-test
