- To install this module you need to install EBox base, squid and 
  dansguardian  before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- Do not run  squid  nor  dansguardian on startup, this module 
  takes control of both of them:

mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXsquid /etc/rc2.d/K20squid
mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXdansguardian  /etc/rc2.d/K20dansguardian

- Stop  squid and dansguardian if they're running.
