DEPENDENCIES
------------

+ Debian packages:

# apt-get install <package>
	+ slapd
	+ libnet-ldap-perl

+ To install this module you need to install EBox base before.

INSTALLATION
------------

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- LDAP Server installation

	To install OpenLDAP:

        # aptitude install slapd

	When asked by debconf, set 'ebox' as DNS domain name.

	Set the administration password
	
	Permission bits must be set over /var/run/ldapi to access 
	via a UNIX Domain Socket, writing in /etc/default/slapd:

	SLAPD_SERVICES="ldapi:///????x-mod=777"

	(A better approach consists of slapd running as a non root user and 
	setting socket ownership accordingly)

	EBox has to read the ldap administration password from 
	ebox-ldap.passwd, so you must create it.  Where this file is 
	depends on your installation, 
	i.e /var/lib/ebox/conf/ebox-ldap.passwd

	
	Now you must generate a slapd.conf file. Use ebox-init-ldap
	in tools:

		ebox-init-ldap genconfig

	Restart slapd

		/etc/init.d/slapd restart

	The final step consists of populating the ldap database

		ebox-init-ldap populate
