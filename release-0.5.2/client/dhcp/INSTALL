- To install this module you need to install EBox base and dhcp3-server before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- Do not run dhcp3-server on startup, this module takes control of it:

mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXdhcp3-server /etc/rc2.d/K20dhcp3-server

- Stop dhcp3-server if it's running.
