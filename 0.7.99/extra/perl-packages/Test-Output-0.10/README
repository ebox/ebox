Test-Output

Test-Output provides a simple interface for testing output send to STDOUT
or STDERR. A number of different utilies are included to try and be as 
flexible as possible to the tester.

While Test::Output requires Test::Tester during installation, this 
requirement is only for it's own tests, not for what it's testing. One of 
the main ideas behind Test::Output is to make it as self contained as 
possible so it can be included with other's modules. As of this release
the only requirement is to include Test::Output::Tie along with it.
