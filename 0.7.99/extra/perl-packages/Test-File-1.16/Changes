1.16 - Sat Jul  8 15:38:38 2006
	* updated the plan for links.t to have the right number of tests
	* no need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.15 - Wed May 17 21:42:09 2006
	* Updated the distro for copyright and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.14 - Wed Mar  8 12:36:22 2006
	* Added Dylan Martin's test for group_is and group_isnt
	* No need to upgrade unless you need these features

1.13 - Sat Dec 31 13:34:30 2005
	* You need the latest Test::Builder::Tester (0.32 right now) to get
	the owner.t test to pass. I've noted that in the PREREQ_PM.
	* You don't need to upgrade if you already have Test::File
	installed. If you run into a test problem, ensure you have
	the latest Test::Builder::Tester and try again.

1.12 - Sun Dec 25 18:02:58 2005
	* Added the tests owner_is() and owner_isnt() from Dylan Martin

1.11 - Sun Oct  2 05:42:41 2005
* Some strings were mistakenly single-quoted. I meant to interpolate but
didn't use double quotes. Should I lose my Perl license? :)

* Upgrade to get the interpolated error messages.

1.10 - Sun Jun  5 17:34:54 2005
* Fixed Windows testing with patch from Tom Metro. Now that I have a
Windows box, I don't need to guess on some of this stuff.
* There is a minor code change, but you don't need to rush to upgrade
if you already have an installed version.

1.09 - Tue Mar  8 17:58:28 2005
* Added POD coverage tests: no need to upgrade

1.08 - Thu Jan  6 17:36:20 2005
* added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the 
platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

* Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
on a Windows machine.

1.07 - Mon Jan  3 17:12:51 2005
Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
files by their mode.

1.06 - Sun Sep  5 15:59:40 2004
* Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root privileges, which 
don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - Thu Sep  2 21:27:27 2004
* fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
* cleaned up the distribution a bit
* You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

0.9 - Sun Jul  4 20:34:50 2004
* ported tests to Test::More
* cleaned up dist files, especially Makefile.PL
* fixed up some doc issues in File.pm
* no change in functionality

0.06 - initial version
