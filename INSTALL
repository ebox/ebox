- To install this module you need to install EBox base before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- After "make install" you need to tell EBox Base there is a new module,
  for this purpose you have to use a tool called "eboxmod". This tool
  is shipped with the EBox Base package. You should run it like this:

  	eboxmod install conf/usersandgroups.xmod

  Note that eboxmod needs a module conf file, in this case "conf/usersandgroups.xmod"
  , so we suppose to run it from the top-level from these sources.

- FIXME LDAP Workarounds to allow this module to change squid configuration and start/stop
  the daemon:
  	
		* Make sure the apache user is able to write  /etc/squid.conf
		* Add apache user as sudoer like this: 
				www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
