- To install this module you need to install EBox base before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- After "make install" you need to tell EBox Base there is a new module,
  for this purpose you have to use a tool called "eboxmod". This tool
  is shipped with the EBox Base package. You should run it like this:

  	eboxmod install conf/usersandgroups.xmod

  Note that eboxmod needs a module conf file, in this case "conf/usersandgroups.xmod"
  , so we suppose to run it from the top-level from these sources.


- LDAP Server installation

	To install OpenLDAP:

        # aptitude install slapd


	When asked by debconf, set 'ebox' as domain and 'exus' as organization.

	Set an administrative password (needed to add users), and disable support for LDAP v2.


	Permission bits must be set over /var/run/ldapi to access via a UNIX Domain Socket, writing in /etc/default/slapd:

	SLAPD_SERVICES="ldapi:///????x-mod=777"

	(A better approach consists of slapd running as a non root user and setting socket ownership accordingly)


- FIXME LDAP Workarounds to allow this module to change squid configuration and start/stop
  the daemon:
  	
		* Make sure the apache user is able to write  /etc/squid.conf
		* Add apache user as sudoer like this: 
				www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
