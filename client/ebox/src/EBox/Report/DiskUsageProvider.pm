#  Any module which wants add one or more section to the disk usage report must
#  subclass this module and override the _facilitiesForDiskUsage method.  Some
#  modules with special needs may want to override the diskUsage method instead

# Method: diskUsage
#  return the different facilities which takes up disk space and the amount used
# in block size units
#
#  Named parameters:
#     blockSize - size of the block units (mandatory)
#     fileSystem - if present, we will only scan the supplied filesystem
#
#  Returns:
#
#   A reference to a hash which ocntains the used filesystem as keys
#   and a hash with the disk usage by facility or pseudo-facilty.
#     The facilities are named with his printable name 
#
#  Bugs:
#    doesn't take account symbolic links
#    see _facilitiesForDiskUsage warnings

# Warning:
#   if the directories overlap some files will be counted twice
#   any directory specified shouldn't have a directory in another filesystem or 
#   we will have a bad filesystem usage count
