# Class: EBox::Event::Dispatcher::Abstract
#
# This class is the base for developing all event dispatchers by any
# module. It should inherit in order to have support for dispatching
# events within eBox framework. Every subclass should just dispatch an
# event from fixed transport way

# Constructor: new
#
#       The constructor for the <EBox::Event::Dispatcher::Abstract> object
#
# Parameters:
#
#       domain - String the Gettext domain for this event watcher
#
#       - Positional parameters
#
# Returns:
#
#       <EBox::Event::Watcher::Abstract> - the newly created object
#
# Exceptions:
#
#       <EBox::Exceptions::MissingArgument> - thrown if any argument
#       is missing

# Method: receiver
#
#       Accessor to the receiver of what this event dispatcher
#       does. If <EBox::Event::Dispatcher::Abstract::_description> is not
#       overridden, an empty string is returned.

# Method: configured
#
#       Indicate if the dispatcher transport layer is already

#
#       Set the dispatcher to work through a given configuration. This

#       test that it is enable to send the information to the
#       receiver.
#
#       An example could be the control center dispatcher that it will
#       be test its connectivity to the listening server.
#
# Returns:

#       events

# Exceptions:

# Parameters:

# Method: _description
#
#      The i18ned method to describe the event receiver. To be

# Returns:

#
#       It will test that it is enable to send the information to the

#
#       An example could be the control center dispatcher that it will
