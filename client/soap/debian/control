Description: SOAP server to communicate with eBox control center
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 This module adds a SOAP server to communicate with an eBox control center.
 The control center is able to handle several eBoxes at the same time using
 a very secure communication (VPN+HTTPS) over the Internet.
