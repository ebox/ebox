Description: eBox - Monitoring module  
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.

 This module adds monitoring service to eBox using collectd to gather
 statistics about your eBox installation to show them in beautiful graphs 
 as well as notifying events when a certain threshold has been reached
