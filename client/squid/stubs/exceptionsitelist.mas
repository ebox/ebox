#Sites in exception list
#Don't bother with the www. or
#the http://
#
#These are specifically domains and are not URLs.
#For example 'foo.bar/porn/' is no good, you need
#to just have 'foo.bar'.
#
#You can also match IPs here too.
#
#As of DansGuardian 2.7.3 you can now include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example
