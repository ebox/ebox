#domains in banned list
#Don't bother with the www. or the http://

#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site

#As of DansGuardian 2.7.3 you can now include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example

#List other sites to block:
% foreach my $domain (@domains) {
<% $domain %>
	
% }


# Blanket Block.  To block all sites except those in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**':
% if ($blanketBlock) {
**
% }

#Blanket IP Block.  To block all sites specified only as an IP
#remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ip':
% if ($blockIp) {
*ip
% }

#Remove the # from the following and edit as needed to use a stock
#squidGuard/urlblacklist blacklists collection.
