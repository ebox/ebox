Description: Proxy cache and content filter
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds a transparent proxy cache, a HTTP content filter,
 object access policies, banned/allowed domains and custom MIME type
 and file extension filter to your eBox installation.
