# Method: staticIfaceAddressChanged
#
#	Invoked when the address of an static network interface is going to 
#	be changed, this method receives the old and new addresses and masks 
#	as arguments. Returning a true value means that this 
#	module's configuration would become inconsistent if such a change
#	was made. In that case the network module will not make the change, 
#	but warn the user instead. You should override this method if you need
#	to.
#
# Parameters:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldaddr - old address
#	oldmask - old mask
#	newaddr - new address
#	newmask - new mask
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub staticIfaceAddressChanged # (iface, oldaddr, oldmask, newaddr, newmask)
{
        return undef;
}

#
# Method: ifaceMethodChanged
#
# 	Invoked when the configuration method for a network interface is 
#	going to change. Both the old and new methods are passed as 
#	arguments to this function. They are strings: static, dhcp,
#	trunk or notset. As with the previous function, a return value of 
#	true will prevent the change from being made. You should override this
#	method if you need to.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldmethod - old method
#	newmethod - newmethod
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub ifaceMethodChanged # (iface, oldmethod, newmethod)
{
        return undef;
}

#
# Method: vifaceDelete
#
#	Invoked when a  virtual interface is going to be removed. Its 
#	arguments are the real interface  which it's going to be removed from, 
#	the name of the  interface to remove, its ip address and its netmask. It
#	works the same way: return true if the removal of the virtual 
#	interface is incompatible with your module's current configuration.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#	newmethod - newmethod
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub vifaceDelete # (iface, viface)
{
        return undef;
}

#
# Method: vifaceAdded
#
#	Invoked when a new virtual interface is going to be created. Its 
#	arguments are the real interface to which it's going to be added, 
#	the name of the new interface, its ip address and its netmask. It
#	works the same way: return true if the creation of the virtual 
#	interface is incompatible with your module's current configuration.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#	newmethod - newmethod
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub vifaceAdded # (iface, viface, address, netmask)
{
        return undef;
}

#
# Method: freeIface
#
#	Invoked when a interface is going to be removed. Its argument
#	is the name of the real interface. It works exactly
#	the same way as the three methods above.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub freeIface # (iface)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
}

#
# Method: freeViface
#
#	Invoked when a virtual interface is going to be removed. Its arguments
#	are the names of the real and virtual interfaces. It works exactly
#	the same way as the three methods above.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub freeViface # (iface, viface)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
