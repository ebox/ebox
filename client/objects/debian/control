Description: eBox - Object management
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds object support, allowing to manage objects which could be
 used as access control lists (ACL) by other modules. Each object represents 
 a certain number of hosts or network, providing an abstraction 
 to make easy its use across the eBox modules.
