# Method: firewallHelper 
#
#       All modules using any of the functions in FirewallHelper.pm 
#       should override this method to return the implementation
#       of that interface.
#
# Returns:
#
#       An object implementing EBox::FirewallHelper
sub firewallHelper
{
	return undef;
}

# Method: usesPort 
#
#	This method is used by the firewall to find out if a given port
#	is available or not. So if your module implements the 
#	EBox::FirewallHelper to allow some ports for the service it manages,
#	you must implement this method to inform about this when requested.
#	This means you should check if the requested port is used by your
#	service.
#	
# Parameters:
#
#   	protocol - protocol (tcp|udp)
#	port - port number
#	iface - interface
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - if the given port is used
sub usesPort # (protocol, port, iface)
{
	return undef;
