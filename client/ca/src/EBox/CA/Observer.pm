# Method: certificateRevoked
#
#	Invoked when a certificate is gonna be revoked, this method
#	receives the common name which identifies the certificate and
#	if it is the CA certificate. Returning a true value means that
#	this module's configuration would become inconsistent if such
#	the revokation is made. In that case the CA module will
#	not make the change, but warn the user instead. You should
#	override this method if you need to.
#
# Parameters:
#
#	commonName - common name which identifies the certificate
#       isCACert   - is the CA certificate?
#
# Returns:
#
#	 true  - if module's configuration becomes inconsistent
#        false - otherwise

# Method: certificateExpired
#
# 	Invoked when a certificate has expired or is about to do
# 	it. You should override this method if you need to. It cannot
# 	be prevented since time is time.
#
# Parameteres:
#
#       commonName - common name which identifies the certificate
#       isCACert   - is the CA certificate?

# Method: freeCertificate
#
# 	Tells this module that an certificate is going to be revoked or has expired,
#       so that it can remove it from its configuration.
#
# Parameteres:
#
#       commonName - common name which identifies the certificate
#

    # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
