Description: 
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 This module adds a Certification Authority Manager over OpenSSL to issue,
 revoke and renew certificates, also allowing download the key pair created
 by this authority and adding the possibility to control the issued certificates that are about to expire.
