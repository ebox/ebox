- To install this module you need to install:
     + eBox components
        libebox
        ebox
        network
        firewall
     + Debian packages
        dhcp3-server

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- Do not run dhcp3-server on startup, this module takes control of it
  using runit:

ebox-runit

- Stop dhcp3-server if it's running.
