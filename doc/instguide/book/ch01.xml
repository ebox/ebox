		<title>What is eBox?</title>

		<para>eBox is a platform for the development and deployment of security
		and work-group related services on a local network. It is configured
		through a web interface that integrates all services in a consistent
		and easy to use way. Its goal is to be usable by non-experts.</para>

		<para>eBox is meant to be installed on a dedicated machine, all
		configuration tasks are performed through the eBox web interface. This
		means that the configuration of the underlying services is one-way:
		eBox modules generate configuration files, overwriting system files in
		some cases (although that tends to be avoided if possible) and manual
		changes to those files are not detected by eBox. This simplifies the
		implementation and usage of the package but has the disadvantage that
		developers need to be careful if they use their own system for testing
		purposes.</para>

		<para>eBox design is modular, new modules providing new services and
		features can be developed independently from its core package. eBox
		simplifies the deployment of new modules and the updates of existing
		ones with a software management module, which is also independent from
		the eBox base package.</para>

		<para>The system is based on Linux and has been developed on top of
		Debian, no support is provided for other Linux distributions as there
		are some debianisms in some of the modules. Porting to other Linux
		distributions should be quite easy, and porting to other Unix like
		operating systems such as OpenBSD would take a little more work but it
		should still be doable, and worth it.</para>
