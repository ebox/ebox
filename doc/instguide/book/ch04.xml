		<title>Installing eBox using the Debian packages</title>

		<para>eBox is available as Debian packages which can be easily
		installed using apt-get.</para>

		<para>First of all you should have a clean Debian Sarge installation
		with a 2.6 kernel. Then you just need to add the following line to your
		<filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>:
		<screen>
		deb http://projects.warp.es/ebox/debian/ ./
		</screen>
		After running <command>apt-get update</command> you should be able to
		get a list of available ebox packages by running:
		<screen>
		apt-cache -n search ebox
		</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
		Once you have performed the previous steps you just need to install the
		desired packages using:
		<screen>
		apt-get install ebox-&lt;module&gt;
		</screen>
		This command should install every other required package, so you
		shouldn't bother with module dependencies.
		</para>

		<para>
		For example, to get a eBox like the one installed in the previous chapter
		with firewall and proxy capabilities you should just run:
		<screen>
		apt-get install ebox-firewall ebox-squid
		</screen>
		This will download the required packages, install them and configure
		everything correctly. After the process has finished you can access the
		eBox administrative interface in <ulink
		url="https://&lt;ip-address&gt;/"/> .
