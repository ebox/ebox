    <para>You can enter into DHCP Server configuration
    going into
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>DHCP</guimenu>
    </menuchoice>
    .
    </para>

    <para>You just will be able to configure DHCP server if there is any
    network interface declared as Static. If there are different
    interfaces set as static, you could choose which one will be
    configured through the selection element. DHCP server works as
    well with virtual static interfaces. In order to serve IP
    addresses in a static interface is required to set at least a range
    or a fixed address mapping.</para>

    <para>If you want to enable DHCP server, check out <xref
    linkend="sect-mod-status"/> for details to do so.</para>

    <para>Working configuration about DHCP server can be adjusted with

                          option points to another computer. If it set

                          include all files to load in thin client
                          such as boot files and parameters in a fixed

          <para>Range lists can be created with some values you would
          like to assign to network hosts. These lists must not have matches
          between them and every allocatable addresses must belong to
          the available range shown above the ranges list.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Static assignments</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A fixed IP can be assigned (if belongs to the
          available range) to a MAC address from the network. You just
          need to create an item at the static assignation list which has
          the MAC address and the required IP address.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    Take into account that every setting in ranges list and fixed
    address mappings must not overlap each other. Not only in the same
    interface but also in the remainder ones. These checks are done
    automatically by eBox.
