    <para>
      There are two working modes to this module. It
      can behave as a simple File Server using SMB/CIFS protocols or
      as well as a centralized authenticate method using Primary Domain
      Controller (PDC) to login on Windows NT-based.

    <para>
      Both working modes needs the following fields configured:
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Domain name</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Only machines and users who belong to the same domain can
	      share their files between them. With this name eBox will
	      be recognize within the local network.

            contains a set of configuration settings from a Windows
            machine which belongs to the domain. Those directories are
            stored in the server host if this option is
            enabled. Default value is disabled because of the LAN
            traffic overload when starting up a machine since every
            directory should be downloaded from the server which may
            include mail boxes and more data...

    <para>
      If file sharing module is installed and enabled in eBox,
      you may want to share files among users within the same group or
      publish files within the local network. To achieve so, you
      should go into
      <menuchoice>
	<guimenu>Users</guimenu>
      </menuchoice>
      and edit the user which can publish files on the local
      network. There, you can enable this user to do so and ,
      furthermore, you can set him administrative rights to add
      machines to the domain, if the working mode is
      <emphasis>PDC</emphasis>. Check <link
