    <title>Network services in eBox</title>
    <para>
      As it happened in <xref linkend="ch-objects"/>, the network
      services are an abstraction to ease the management of your
      network. Each network service describes a set of ports for
      Internet protocols where service accepts requests. Providing a
      name plus an optional description allows
      you to manage the network service policies more intuitively and
      less error-prone.
    </para>
    <para>
      The network services are used by firewall module (<xref
      linkend="ch-firewall"/>) and traffic shaping module (<xref
      linkend="ch-trafficshaping"/>). Anyway, as eBox philosophy every
      feature which use a network service must use this module to work
      with and ease the administration life.

    <para>
      As you may notice, there are several ones which
      have been created by eBox for you. These services are used by
      eBox modules afterwards. For instance, <emphasis>dhcp</emphasis>
      service is described as an internal service called
      '<emphasis>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</emphasis>'. As
      you may notice, this service is read-only as it is already
      managed by dhcp module automatically. Each service has a
      configuration where the service protocol, well-known source and
      destination ports are set. There are three special services
      which define the generic abstraction for every service
      (<emphasis>any</emphasis>) and every TCP/UDP service. They are
      entered to handle easily rules defined in other modules that
      depends on this network services.

      You might inspect several system-defined services prior to add
      your own ones. Anyway, a user-defined service may be created
      when additional network services be installed on top of an eBox
      installation, for example introducing a <emphasis>NNTP (Network News
      Transfer Protocol)</emphasis> service.
