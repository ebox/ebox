		<title>Port Redirects</title>

		<para>Port redirects allow to get external traffic
		into a host behind a eBox system with firewall module
		installed. You can get the configuration of these
		options at
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Firewall</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Redirects</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you need to add a new redirect, first select your
		desired <guilabel>Interface</guilabel> which will
		listen incoming connections. This should be one of the
		interfaces previously selected as external. Moreover,
		it should be assigned the <guilabel>External
		port</guilabel> where you expect your incoming
		traffic, and the <guilabel>protocol</guilabel> that
		will be used.</para>

		<para>You should enter the destination system
		<guilabel>IP adress</guilabel> and its
		<guilabel>Port</guilabel> where packets would go
		on.</para>
	        
		<para>Once you have selected this data, you just need
		to select between the different
		<guilabel>Actions</guilabel>, the
		<guilabel>Add</guilabel> one, and click on it.</para>
				
		<para>To remove a rule, you should select remove
		between the available <guilabel>Actions</guilabel>,
		and click on it.</para>

		<para>Redirect configuration can be modified by
		changing its parameters and clicking on their modify
		<guilabel>Actions</guilabel>.</para>

		<!-- Firewall->Packet Filter -->
		<title>Packet filter</title>

		<para>
		From
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Firewall</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Packet filter</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		you can configure general packet filter rules or
		define them to each network object.
		</para>

		<para>At configuration window we can stablish a deny
		policy for network packets. If you select this deny
		policy, it will be notified to the sender that the
		packet will be denied on destination. If you select an
		ignoration policy for network packets, they will be
		filtered and discarded without any notification.
		</para>

		<para>
		Making a click on Packet filer rules, you can access
		to a rule list for the eBox firewall. Each rule can be
		enabled or disabled without remove it. These rules,
		will be applied from top to bottom, so order could be
		important. On each rule, you can select its
		transmission protocol, which action to apply if a
		packet matches this rule (accept it or deny it),
		origin adress and port and destination adress and
		port. When specifying an adress or a port, you can
		choose which ones belongs to the rule or which not, to
		enhace its flexibility and clearness of the rules,
		reducing the amount.
		</para>

		<para>
		Inside <guilabel>Default rules
		configuration</guilabel>, we can stablish rules to be
		applied by default to each eBox object. This includes
		a general policy for the object, denying or accepting
		some services selectables from a list. It also
		includes the creation of a specific rules list for the
		object, which allow or deny connections with a
		protocol, a destination adress (with a network mask)
		and certain ports. These rules can be enabled or
		disabled without removing them, as in eBox filtering rules</para>

		<para>
		At the bottom, we can choose an eBox network object
		from the selection list, and clicking on "Go", to
		apply the specified packet filtering rules. Between
		the selectable options for network objects we find:
		fix a specific policy or use a global policy,
		accepting or denying some services, from the Services
		selection list, and create rules for the object in the
		same way they are created for the global policy.
