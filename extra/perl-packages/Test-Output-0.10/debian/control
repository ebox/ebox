Description:  Utilities to test STDOUT and STDERR messages.
 Test::Output provides a simple interface for testing output sent to STDOUT
 or STDERR. A number of different utilies are included to try and be as
 flexible as possible to the tester.
 .
 Originally this module was designed not to have external requirements, 
 however, the features provided by Sub::Exporter over what Exporter
 provides is just to great to pass up.
 .
 Test::Output ties STDOUT and STDERR using Test::Output::Tie.

 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
