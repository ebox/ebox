File/Copy/Recursive version 0.29
================================

This module has 3 functions, one to copy files only, one to copy directories 
only and one to do either depending on the argument's type.

The depth to which a directpry structure is copied can be set with:

 $File::Copy::Recursive::Maxdepth

setting it back to false or non numeric value will turn it back to unliimited.

All functions attempt to preserve each copied file's mode unless you set
 $File::Copy::Recursive::KeepMode
to false.

 perldoc File::Copy::Recursive
