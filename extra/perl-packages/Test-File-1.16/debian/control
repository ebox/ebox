Description:  Test::File -- test file attributes
 This modules provides a collection of test utilities for file
 attributes.
 .
 Some file attributes depend on the owner of the process testing the
 file in the same way the file test operators do.  For instance, root
 (or super-user or Administrator) may always be able to read files no
 matter the permissions.
 .
 Some attributes don't make sense outside of Unix, either, so some
 tests automatically skip if they think they won't work on the
 platform.  If you have a way to make these functions work on Windows,
 for instance, please send me a patch. :)
