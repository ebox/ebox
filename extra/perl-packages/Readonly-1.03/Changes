Revision history for Perl extension Readonly.

1.03  2004 April 20
	- Changed the prototype for Readonly, to make the usage cleaner.
	 Unfortunately, this breaks backwards-compatability for this
	 function.  Users of this function who have Perl 5.8 or later
	 will have to change their source code.  Also, users of this
	 function who upgrade to perl 5.8+ will have to change their
	 usage.  Having discussed this feature change with a number of
	 people, I felt that breaking compatability was worth the gain
	 in simplicity of usage.
	 (Thanks to Damian Conway for the suggestion).
	 - Removed "use warnings" so the module will work in perl 5.005.

1.02  2003 May 13
	- If Readonly::XS is installed, Readonly will use it for
	   making scalars read-only.
	- Callers are now forbidden to tie variables directly.  This
	   prevents sneaky callers from reassigning a variable via
	   tie.
	- Error messages have been changed to be more like Perl's
	   own "Modification of a read-only value attempted at..."
	- Catch and return an error if user tries to pass a constant
	  to Readonly::Scalar (eg Readonly::Scalar 'hello', 'goodbye')
	- Include a simple benchmark script.
	- Add a few more test cases.  You can never have too many.
	- Add a simple benchmark program.

1.01  2003 February 14
	- Add some checking to prevent reassignment of Readonly variables.
	- Changed my email address in the docs.

1.00  2003 January 7
	- No code changes.  No bugs or suggestions have been reported
	  for six months, so the version number is changing to 1.00.

0.07  2002 June 25
	- Clean up the code somewhat; remove redundancies; delay
	   loading Carp.pm until it's needed.
	- Fixed the list of EXPORT_OK symbols.

0.06  2002 June 16
        - Add Readonly function, to provide a unified (and shorter) way to
          create readonly variables. (Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the idea).
        - Scalar, Array, and Hash now mark entire data structures as Readonly.
          Added Scalar1, Array1, and Hash1 for shallow Readonly protection.
          (Thanks to Ernest Lergon for the idea).
        - Switch to Test::More and Test::Harness.  134 tests now!

0.05  2002 March 15
	- Change name from Constant.pm to Readonly.pm, due to file
	  naming conflict under Windows.
	- Changed docs to match.
	- Allow Readonly::Hash to accept a hash reference parameter.
	- Works better with older versions of Perl.
	- Add many, many test cases to test.pl.

0.04  2002 March 7
	- Add top-level Scalar, Array, and Hash functions, so callers
	  don't have to tie the variables themselves.

	- documentation changes only.

0.02  2001 September 9
	- documentation changes only.

0.01  2001 August 30
