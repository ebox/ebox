- Samba: Mount username share and all group shares (displayResource) that the
  user can access (we can get the user groups with the 'id' command).

- Asterisk: We only have to configure the username in Ekiga, the realm will
  always be 'ebox' and it will go hardcoded.

- Configure evolution with  mailAccount (taken from ldap), the ports will be
  hardcoded at first.

- Add firefox bookmarks for eGroupware webpage and eBox usercorner

- On the first version usercorner webpage will be hardcoded
  (https://ebox_ip:8888), later will be able to get a different port it has
  been changed.

- Pidgin: We will hardcode 'ebox' as domain at first, and we'll set the
  proper username. The domain will be set correctly later.

- Maybe in the future: ebox-printers?
