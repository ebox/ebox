- Samba: Mount username share and all group shares (displayResource) that the
  user can access (we can get the user groups with the 'id' command).

- Configure evolution with  mailAccount (taken from ldap), the ports will be
  hardcoded at first.

- Add firefox bookmarks for eGroupware webpage and eBox usercorner

- On the first version usercorner webpage will be hardcoded
  (https://ebox_ip:8888), later will be able to get a different port it has
  been changed.

- Pidgin: We have hardcoded 'ebox' as domain at first, and the proper
  username is set. The domain has to be set correctly if has been changed.

- Maybe in the future: ebox-printers?
