Howto create the install CD

1) Edit configuration file

You must edit the file 'build_cd.conf' to reflect your environment. At least you
will need to change the MAINTAINER_ADRESS and YOURKEYID items, probably also the
BASE_DIR variable.  The UBUNTU_KEYRING_TAR and UBUNTU_KEYRING_DIR must changed
to reflect the version number of the package.  The VERSION and the
VERSION_NUMBER keys must reflect the version name and number of the Ubuntu
version remastered for create the CD.

2) Put extra ubuntu packages

You must put all extra .deb archives in the directory pointed by the key
EXTRAS_DIR (in build_cd.conf).  Today the extra packages needed are all
eBox packages and its dependencies not already provided by the base CD.  Tip: A
way to get dependencies is to put in extras the stuff, install the CD and scan
the install log to see what pacakges are downlaoded from the mirror. Another way
is to have a list of packages and use the packagesNotInCd script to see which
aren't included, anyway check the log ater the installation to find any missing
package/.

2.1) Put eBox metapackages

They are built from trunk/extra/ebox-metapackages, you can export it
somewhere, run dpkg-buildpackage and then add them to the EXTRAS_DIR
directory. Remember to regenerate the Packages.gz with apt-ftparchive packages.

3) Change if needed eBox's server files

In the director pointed by DATA_DIR there are some files that either are used
in the install process (preseed, install scripts) or installed verbatim
(inittab, ..).  If you need it you can edit them.

4) Download ubuntu-keyring tar

Download the tar source of this package, be sure this file is correctly
referenced by the UBUNTU_KEYRING_TAR key.  Remember that the YOURKEYID must be
the gpg ID of the key you will use to sign the CD. You can dget its .dsc from
http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/karmic/ubuntu-keyring.

5) Download the ubuntu server iso and setup the build directory

You need to download the ISO file to remaster.  After download it, execute the
setup_build_dir.sh command.

6) Make sure you have the latest version of the EBox::Gettext perl package in
your perl path. You can get it from the sources or from the libebox package.

7) Execute the build CD script

Execute the ./build_cd.sh script, it will ask you about your gpg passphrase a
few times. If the build was sucessful you'll have your ISO written to the file
pointed by the ISO_IMAGE key.
