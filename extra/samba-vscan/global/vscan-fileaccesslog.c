 * File Access Log - stores information about LRU files
 *
 * Copyright (C) Rainer Link, 2002-2003
 *	 	 OpenAntiVirus.org <rainer@openantivirus.org>
 *
 * This module is used to detect whether Windows opens the same file
 * again and again several times (in a very short time of period), i.e.
 * when double-clicking a file. So, i.e. if you click on an infected
 * word file, Windows tries to open it several times until it reports
 * the "Access denied" back to the user.
 * 
 * It uses some kind of last recently used machanism, so the most LRU
 * file is stored at the end of a doubled-linked list. So, new entries
 * are added at the end of the list, but also the search function moves a
 * found entry to the end of the list.
 *
 * An entry stores information about the file name, the modify time (mtime),
 * a flag indicates if a file is marked as infected or not and the time
 * the entry was created.
