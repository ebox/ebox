* the default value to be compiled for is now Samba 2.2.8  
* extended error messages when connection to anti-virus daemon failed

[samba-vscan 0.3.2]
* added a very basic ICAP client for use with Symantec AntiVirus Engine 4.x 
* added a mechanism to avoid scanning of the same file multiples times in
  a very short period of time (i.e. when user double-clicks a file)
* bugfix for F-Prot module (scanning of files containing space(s) is now
  possible)
* updated for mks. It uses now a library by MkS, licensed under the terms
  of the LGPL. Thanks to Dariusz Markowicz for the patch.

[samba-vscan 0.3.1]
* virus notification via windows winpopup service
* an infected file can now be either deleted, moved into quarantine
  or left untouched
* various smaller enhancements and bugfixes
* code re-organisation for a better re-use of code. The aim is to have
  sooner or later some kind of a framework to be able to write new
  modules very easily
* informational messages will be logged using the INFO tag
* documentation updated to reflect recent changes

[samba-vscan 0.3.0]
* Symantec support has been removed due to licensing issues (linking GPL-
  code against non-GPL library)
* the Sophos and Trend Module has been re-written to use Sophie and
  Trophie (see http://www.vanja.com/tools/) to avoid licensing issues
  as mentioned above
* added support for the recent Samba 3.0 alpha releases
* added the possiblilty to use a run-time, samba-stylish configuration file
  on a per share basis (via "vfs options" setting in smb.conf), requires 
  recent Samba 2.2.x or Samba 3.0 (alpha)
* for better (automatic) log checking, error messages start with the
  ERROR tag, virus messages start with the ALERT tag
* the client IP of the client maschine, retrieving/storing an infected
  file will be logged in the virus alert message
* improved init message, to see for which Samba release a module was 
  compile for (helps /me when doing end-user support :))
* documentation has been rewritten 


[samba-vscan 0.2.5]
* virus scanning on close can now performed, too
* if virus scanning on open or on close (or both) should be performed 
  is now configurable at compile time
* if the VFS module can not communicate to the virus scanning daemon
  or initialisation of the used virus scanning API fails, it's possible 
  now to deny access to a file just being opened because virus scanning
  can not performed in such a case. This is configurable at compile time

[samba-vscan 0.2.5 beta2]
* use stat() provided by Samba, not directly the stat() of libc
* use ANSI C lib functions to communicate with ScannerDaemon and F-Prot
  Daemon

* set errno to EACCES

[samba-vscan 0.2.0]
