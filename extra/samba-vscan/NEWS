[samba-vscan 0.3.0]
* Symantec support has been removed due to licensing issues (linking GPL-
  code against non-GPL library)

  ERROR tag, virus messages start with the ALERT tag
* the client IP of the client maschine, retrieving/storing an infected
  file will be logged in the virus alert message

* if virus scanning on open or on close (or both) should be performed 
  is now configurable at compile time
