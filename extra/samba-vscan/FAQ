samba-vscan FAQ
***************

Q: Does samba-vscan send out notification messages if access to an infected
   file is denied?
A: Yes, via the windows messaging service ("winpopup service"), when
   send warning message = yes is set in the corresponding configuration 
   file. 
   Tools like Logcheck (www.psionic.com) or snort (www.snort.org)
   can be used to generate alerts/notification messages for the admin.
   You may change SYSLOG_FACILITY and SYSLOG_PRIORITY, used for normal 
   messages, and SYSLOG_PRIORITY_ALERT for virus messages 
   (see vscan-<product>.h) to fit your needs.

Q: What happens with infected files?
A: Depends on the "infected file action" setting in the corresponding 
   configuration file. An infected file may moved into quarantine, deleted
   or left untouched.

Q: Using vscan-samba slows down using file shares / connecting to new
   shares. Why?
A: Win* uses only one connection for all shares you're connected to. 
   Therefore a smbd client is forked only once and only one instance of
   samba-vscan module is created. So, if scanning of a large file takes
   some time, this process will slow down all shares. See
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=100629451400005&w=2&r=1 for details.
   I currently have no clue how to avoid this problem :-(
   Keep also in mind this causes issues with run-time configuration, i.e.
   if you use two or more samba-vscan modules with different configuration
   (the latter one overwrites the other one(s)) - log entries via syslog
   are also misleading (everything is logged with the name of the first
   loaded VFS module)

Q: Using this module I can't access any file containing german
   umlauts or special characters. Why?
A: When using samba-vscan unicode support seems to be broken. I'm currently
   not sure if the provided VFS patch break it or if unicode support
   is broken within the VFS layer in general. 
   See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=100662550000001&w=2&r=1 or
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=samba-technical&m=100681100607866&w=2
   for details. I'm not sure, if this is still valid in  recent Samba 
   releases, i.e. 2.2.6 (as the time of this writing).
