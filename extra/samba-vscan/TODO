TODO
****

- more testing, esp. in a production environment
- improve and extend documentation
- write VFS modules for more virusscanners
- for speed reasons, scan only a file (again) if its checksum 
  does not match the stored checksum (i.e. the file has been changed)
- provide the possibility to run a script if a virus is found (i.e.
  to generate an alert mail via script)
- some virus scanners report suspicious files or intended "viruses", which
  are currently not blocked. If they are blocked or not should be configurable
  via the config file mentioned above
- Windows opens file(s) several times, if i.e. a directory is opened in
  Explorer or being double-clicked. Need a good mechanism to detect this
  and avoid scanning of the same file several times in a very short period
  of time. This should be mainly fixed by now, but probably we should hook
  the VFS write function to delete an entry in the lru file list ...
- some re-structuring of the code / general code clean-up / security
  code audit
- re-write logger function, to be more flexible (i.e. for each
  class, such as ERROR, INFO, ALERT, be able to specify the
  SYSLOG_LEVEL)
- avoid using global vars as much as possible
- currently, when "quarantine" is selected and quarantining fails, the file
  left untouched. This may not appropriate in all cases, so make this
  configurable (quarantining failing, do nothing)
- improve the renaming of infected files, i.e. 
  <prefix>-<orig-filename>-<timestamp>
- put some extra work into the samba-vscan framework and write a
  developers guide on how to use it to write a new module
- check if all modules are really LFS-aware!
