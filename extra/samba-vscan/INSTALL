Instructions for Samba 2.2.0 to 2.2.3
-------------------------------------

The use of those versions are NOT recommended, as they contain some
security vulnerabilities. Even if your vendor provides patched 
version to fix those issues, those Samba contain a bug which prevents 
the use of run-time configuration settings.
Moreover, VFS support is broken in these Samba releases. I would suggest 
to use the latest 2.2.x release (as the time of this writing Samba 
2.2.8a). 
To get VFS working, you have to apply the provided 
samba-<version>-vfs.dif, re-configure Samba (./configure --enable-vfs) 
and re-compile Samba.

As the parsing for the "vfs options" parameter is broken in these Samba 
releases, you must use the compile-time settings and can not use a run-time
configuration file per share. Once again, please consider to use the latest
2.2.x release.

The following compile time settings are available in 
<product>/vscan-<product>.h, so change into the directory of the anti-virus
product you want to use, i.e. 

cd openantivirus
vi vscan-oav.h  
 
* VSCAN_SCAN_ON_OPEN: if it's set to True (default), files will be scanned on
  open
* VSCAN_SCAN_ON_CLOSE: if it's set to True (default), files will be scanned
  on close
* VSCAN_MAX_SIZE:  scanning a (very) large file may slow down performance 
  (too much). Therefore, you can specify if a file is larger than x bytes, 
  it shouldn't be scanned. Please set it for your needs. If it's set to 0,
  all files, regardless of their file size, will be scanned.  
* VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR:  if communication to the virus scanning daemon 
  fails, you may either deny access to file(s) or not. You can change this 
  behaviour via the VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR setting. If it's set to 
  True (default), access will be _denied_.
* VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_MINOR_ERROR: basically the same as 
  VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR but related to minor errors. Not really
  implemented in all modules. 
* VSCAN_SEND_WARNING_MESSAGE: if it's set to True (default), a virus
  notification message via winpopup service is send to the remote client
  computer. On Windows95/98, the "winpopup" program must be run.
* VSCAN_INFECTED_FILE_ACTION: three values are possible
  	- INFECTED_QUARANTINE: an infected file will be renamed and
	  		       moved into a specific quarantine directory
			       (see below). If quarantining fails, the file
			       will _not_ be deleted.
	- INFECTED_DELETE:     an infected file will be removed
	- INFECTED_DO_NOTHING: the infected file will remain untouched
* SCAN_QUARANTINE_DIRECTORY: the quarantine directory for infected files,
  default is "/tmp" - it should be a directory not reachable via (Samba)
  shares.
* VSCAN_QUARANTINE_PREFIX: a quarantined file will be renamed, via this
  setting the prefix can be specified. Default is "vir-". 
* VSCAN_MAX_LRUFILES: the maximum number of last recently accessed file entries,
  default is 100. If set to 0, the lru access mechanism is disabled. Please
  see chapter "Avoid multiple scans of a file caused by Windows behaviour".
* VSCAN_LRUFILES_INVALIDATE_TIME: specifies the time in seconds, after an
  lru accessed file entry is considered as invalidated. The default is
  5 seconds.  Please see the chapter "Avoid multiple scans of a file 
  caused by Windows behaviour".

After you may have adjusted these settings to your needs, please
refer to the next section on how to actually build and install
samba-vscan.


Installation instructions for Samba >= 2.2.4 or Samba 3.0
---------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Prerequisite 
VFS support works out-of-the-box in these Samba releases. As for compiling this
module the config.h file of Samba is needed, you have to run ./configure in
<samba-source>/source (yes, you need the Samba sources. A binary-only
Samba installation is not sufficient).

Step 2: copying the sources (optional)
You may copy recursively the complete samba-vscan directory to 
<samba-source>/examples/VFS and make then this directory your working 
directory, i.e.

cp -ra samba-vscan /usr/local/src/samba/examples/VFS
cd /usr/local/src/samba/examples/VFS/samba-vscan

If you do this step, you do not need the configure parameter
--with-samba-source=DIR later on.

Step 3: compile-time settings (optional for Samba 2.2.4 and any later version):
In Samba 2.2.4 and better (or Samba 3.0), the "vfs options" parsing works
correctly, so you can use the run-time configuration file on a per share
basis, if you like. Of course, the compile time settings are still usable
(and will be overwritten by the run-time configuration file, if any)


The following compile time settings are available in 
<product>/vscan-<product>.h, so change into the directory of the anti-virus
product you want to use, i.e. 

cd openantivirus
vi vscan-oav.h  
 
* VSCAN_SCAN_ON_OPEN: if it's set to True (default), files will be scanned on
  open
* VSCAN_SCAN_ON_CLOSE: if it's set to True (default), files will be scanned
  on close
* VSCAN_MAX_SIZE:  scanning a (very) large file may slow down performance 
  (too much). Therefore, you can specify if a file is larger than x bytes, 
  it shouldn't be scanned. Please set it for your needs. If it's set to 0,
  all files, regardless of their file size, will be scanned.  
* VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR: if communication to the virus scanning daemon 
  fails, you may either deny access to file(s) or not. You can change this 
  behaviour via the VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR setting. If it's set to 
  True (default), access will be _denied_.
* VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_MINOR_ERROR: basically the same as 
  VSCAN_DENY_ACCESS_ON_ERROR but related to minor errors. Not really
  implemented in all modules. 
* VSCAN_SEND_WARNING_MESSAGE: if it's set to True (default), a virus
  notification message via winpopup service is send to the remote client
  computer. On Windows95/98, the "winpopup" program must be run.
* VSCAN_INFECTED_FILE_ACTION: three values are possible
  	- INFECTED_QUARANTINE: an infected file will be renamed and
	  		       moved into a specific quarantine directory
			       (see below). If quarantining fails, the file
			       will _not_ be deleted.
	- INFECTED_DELETE:     an infected file will be removed
	- INFECTED_DO_NOTHING: the infected file will remain untouched
* SCAN_QUARANTINE_DIRECTORY: the quarantine directory for infected files,
  default is "/tmp" - it should be a directory not reachable via (Samba)
  shares.
* VSCAN_QUARANTINE_PREFIX: a quarantined file will be renamed, via this
  setting the prefix can be specified. Default is "vir-". 
* VSCAN_MAX_LRUFILES: the maximum number of last recently accessed file entries,
  default is 100. If set to 0, the lru access mechanism is disabled. Please
  see section "Avoid multiple scans of a file caused by Windows behaviour".
* VSCAN_LRUFILES_INVALIDATE_TIME: specifies the time in seconds, after an
  lru accessed file entry is considered as invalidated. The default is 5
  seconds. Please see the chapter "Avoid multiple scans of a file caused 
  by Windows behaviour".

Step 4: build
Now run the ./configure script. If you didn't copy the samba-vscan
directory to <samba-src>/examples/VFS, you must use the 
--with-samba-source=DIR option, which must point to the source directory
of the Samba sources, e.g.

./configure --with-samba-source=/usr/local/src/samba/source

(see configure --help for all available options)

The configure script will detect the Samba version and flags needed
for build samba-vscan. If the Samba version can not be autodetected,
as e.g. your vendor uses it's own version (e.g. 3.0-vendor) please use
--with-samba-version=VERSION to set the version correctly. 

To compile the samba-vscan backends (the VFS modules), simply type "make". 

If you want to build only (a) specific backend(s), simply type 
"make <backend1> [<backend2>]", e.g.

"make fprotd" to build only the fprotd backend (vscan-fprotd.so) or 
"make fprotd oav sophos" to build the fprotd OpenAntiVirus and 
Sophos backend (vscan-fprotd.so, vscan-oav.so, vscan-sophos.so).

Step 5: install
After compilation has finished, copy the vscan-<product>.so (i.e. vscan-oav.so)
to /usr/local/samba/lib/vfs (this is the default location of Samba 3.0 - 
depending on your vendor/distribution, the location may vary).

Otherwise, "make install" should work, too.


If you want to use the run-time configuration file copy the
corresponding .conf file to /etc/samba, i.e.

cp -a openantivirus/vscan-oav.conf /etc/samba

Note: "make install" does not copy configuration file(s).

Step 6: configure Samba

Samba 2.2.x:

Edit /etc/smb.conf and add the following entry (that's only an example):
  [vscan]
                comment = virus-protected /tmp directory
                path = /tmp
                vfs object = /usr/lib/samba/vfs/vscan-oav.so
		vfs options = config-file = /etc/samba/vscan-oav.conf
                writeable = yes
                browseable = yes
                guest ok = yes


Basically you have to add a vfs object line to your shares
which should be virus-protected by this module. If you'd like to use the
run-time configuration file, simply add the 
vfs options = config-file = /path/config-file
(different settings for several shares can be achieved by using a different
name of the configuration file for each share). If you want to protect _all_
shares your Samba server offers, simply add the vfs object line (and the
vfs options line, if you like) to the [global] section.

Samba 3.0:

Edit /etc/smb.conf and add the following entry (that's only an example):
  [vscan]
                comment = virus-protected /tmp directory
                path = /tmp
                vfs object = vscan-oav
                vscan-oav: config-file = /etc/samba/vscan-oav.conf
                writeable = yes
                browseable = yes
                guest ok = yes

IMPORTANT: vscan-oav: config-file = /path/file is refers, as the
name already implies to the vscan-oav module only. So, generally
speaking it's vscan-<backend>: config-file = /path/file


Basically you have to add a vfs object line to your shares
which should be virus-protected by this module. If you'd like to use the
run-time configuration file, simply add the 
vscan-<backend>: config-file = /path/config-file
(different settings for several shares can be achieved by using a different
name of the configuration file for each share). If you want to protect _all_
shares your Samba server offers, simply add the vfs object line (and the
vscan-<backend>: config-file = /file/path line, if you like) to the 
[global] section.



The following options are available in the samba-style run-time configuration 
file for each anti-virus product (some additional settings are available, 
please refer to the corresponding configuration file):

* max file size = <value>
  This setting can be used to exclude (very) large files from scanning. <value>
  is an integer value (bytes). If set to 0 (default), all files will be scanned.

* verbose file logging = <boolean>
  Specifies whether every scan of a file should be logged (therefore, clean 
  files will be logged, too). If set to yes (or True or 1), everything will 
  be logged.
  If set to no (or False or 0), only access to infected files will be logged
  (this is the default)

* scan on open = <boolean>
  If set to yes (or True or 1), a file will be scanned while opening it. Default
  is yes.

* scan on close = <boolean>
  If set to yes (or True or 1), a file will be scanned while closing. Default
  is yes.

* deny access on error = <boolean>
  If set to yes (or True or 1), access to file will be denied if communication
  to the virus scanning daemon has failed (and therefore could not be scanned).
  Default is yes.

* deny access on minor error = <boolean>
  Similar to "deny access on error" but only for minor errors. Not implemented
  for all modules. Default is yes.

* send warning message = <boolean>
  If set to yes (or True or 1), a warning message via Windows Messenger 
  Service (winpopup) will be send when a virus was found. Note: on Win95/
  Win98 the "winpopup" client must be running. Default is yes.

* infected file action = <quarantine|delete|nothing>
  If set to "quarantine", an infected file will be moved and renamed to
  a specified quarantine directory (see below). If this fails, the file will
  be deleted. If set to "delete" the infected file will be deleted. If set to
  "nothing" an infected file will be untouched. Default is "quarantine".

* quarantine directory = <string>
  Specifies the quarantine directory. Default is "/tmp", please change this
  for your needs. The quarantine directory must not be reached via samba 
  share. 

* quarantine prefix = <string>
  Prefix for files in quarantine, default is "vir-".  

* max lru files entries = <value>
  As Windows tries to open a file multiple times in a (very) short period
  of time, samba-vscan use a last recently accessed file mechanism to avoid
  multiple scans of the same file. This setting specified the maximum number 
  of entries for the last recently accessed files list. If set to 0, this
  mechanism is disabled completely. The default is 100. Please see the chapter
  "Avoid multiple scans of a file caused by Windows behaviour".


* lru file entry lifetime = <value>
  Specified the lifetime of an entry in the lru accessed files list in seconds.
  The default is 5. After this lifetime an entry is considered as invalidated
  and deleted from the list. Please see the chapter "Avoid multiple scans of 
  a file caused by Windows behaviour".
   

Step 7: Restart Samba
Restart Samba (e.g. killall -HUP smbd)

If you want to test, if everything works well, simply do the following steps
copy eicar.com to /tmp
smbclient //localhost/vscan
  At the smbclient command line try to retrieve eicar.com
  - get eicar.com
    -> access should be denied!!!
everything should be logged via syslog


Avoid multiple scans of a file caused by Windows behaviour
----------------------------------------------------------

Windows (I think all versions) may open file(s) several times in a very short
period of time, when i.e. opening a directory or double-clicking on a file. 

Here are two real-world examples, created using vscan-fprotd with
verbose loging switched on. 

Double-clicking on an infected Word document:
Jan  4 14:46:49 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC'
Jan  4 14:46:50 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: ALERT - Scan result: '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC' infected with virus 'WM/CAP.A', client: '172.16.14.129'
Jan  4 14:46:50 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC'
Jan  4 14:46:50 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: ALERT - Scan result: '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC' infected with virus 'WM/CAP.A', client: '172.16.14.129'
Jan  4 14:46:51 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC'
Jan  4 14:46:51 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: ALERT - Scan result: '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC' infected with virus 'WM/CAP.A', client: '172.16.14.129'
Jan  4 14:46:52 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/macroviren/CAP-A.DOC'

Double-clicking on a not-infected Word document:
Jan  4 14:50:26 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: file /tmp/test.doc is clean
Jan  4 14:50:26 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/test.doc'
Jan  4 14:50:26 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: file /tmp/test.doc is clean
Jan  4 14:50:27 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/test.doc'
Jan  4 14:50:27 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: file /tmp/test.doc is clean
Jan  4 14:50:28 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: Scanning file : '/tmp/test.doc'
Jan  4 14:50:28 rlss2 smbd_vscan_fprotd[3201]: INFO: file /tmp/test.doc is clean

As these examples demonstrate, those both files have been opened several times
by Windows and therefore scanned several times, although scanning each of them
once would have been sufficient. Of course, this slows down performance.

Since the 0.3.2 release, samba-vscan has a mechanism, to avoid this. It uses 
a last recently accessed file list. Each entry contains the file name, the
last modified date/time and the time, the entry was added to the list.


Log checking
------------

samba-vscan logs nearly everything via the syslog facility. For easier 
automatic log analysis, each syslog message starts with a particular
tag:

INFO - just an informational message
ERROR - error message, i.e. when communication to a daemon has failed
ALERT - a virus has been found


Anti-virus product-specific information
--------------------------------------

As a general hint: once in a while it may happen an antivirus vendor
changes the communication protocol of the product without prior note. So,
esp. when you installed a major update/upgrade of your used anti-virus
product, you should test by retrieving eicar.com (the EICAR Test file
virus, see www.eicar.org) whether samba-vscan still works with it. If not,
please contact us asap.

- F-Prot
  A running F-Prot daemon is required, which runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), 
  port 10200 (up to 10204). The port number (or port numbers) can be changed 
  via VSCAN_FPROTD_PORT in vscan-fprotd.h or the fprot port = <string> setting 
  in the run-time configuration file.
  The arguments passed to the daemon (i.e. to scan inside of archive files) can 
  be set via VSCAN_FPROTD_ARGS in vscan-fprotd.h or fprotd args = <string>
  in the run-time configuration file (default is -dumb%20-archive); remember
  to encode space as %20

- ICAP
  The support for an ICAP anti-virus service is currently at a very early stage,
  so don't expect it to be very stable. Actually, only the Symantec AntiVirus
  Engine 4.x is currently supported. The "ICAPResponse=0" setting _must_ set
  in /opt/SYMCScan/etc/symcscan.cfg (and of course SAVE must be configured to
  use ICAP and not the native protocol!) Moreover, the "ICAPActionPolicy=SCAN"
  option must be set.
 
  The icap-client program (gcc -o icap-client icap-client.c) can be used
  for debugging purposes or to scan a specific file via Symantec AntiVirus
  Engine (sic!). See icap-client -h for details.
 
- Kaspersky Anti Virus
  Install kavplinux linux from Kaspersky.
  You can download a version from www.kaspersky.com
  Install the version according to the docs and make sure that 
  kavdaemon is running. Also make sure that kavdaemon does scan the 
  samba shared directories!!!! Please do check the [object] section
  in defUnix.prf and sure you add something like:
  Names=*/samba_shares
  where samba_shaes is a samba share!
  Please do check if kavdaemon really can scan that directory!
  You can do this by copying a eicar.test file to on of the shares and run:
  $AVPBASEDIR/DaemonClients/Sample/AvpDaemonClient /samba_shares/eicar.com
  The AvpDaemonClient software should now return that a virus was found!

  Then compile the KAV C library. Change into 
  <AVPDIR>/DaemonClients/SampleLibs/C and type
  make
  make install

  This installs kavdclib.so into /usr/lib

  Per default, the daemon socket file is /var/run/AvpCtl. If this isn't true
  on your system, please set either AVPCTL in vscan-kavp.h or 
  avp socket file = <string> in the run-time configuration file accordingly.

  If compiling of the vscan-kavp module fails, please try
  make -f Makefile.KAV4 

  Some hints for building samba-vscan with KAV on RedHat (by Kevin Wang):
   
   Before you start fiddling with samba-vscan, you need the Kaspersky daemon
   client libs compiled and installed:
	cd /opt/AVP/DaemonClients/
	./configure
	make
	cd /opt/AVP/DaemonClients/SampleLibs/C
	make install
	echo /usr/local/lib >>/etc/ld.so.conf
	ldconfig

   Get the SRPM from RedHat, install it, and then use rpmbuild to compile
   the "same" Samba version that RedHat does with these commands as root:
	cd /usr/src/redhat/
	rpmbuild SPECS/samba.spec

   IMPORTANT: if you do a rebuild with rpmbuild, the entire
   BUILD/samba-2.2.7/ directory will get erased, so don't use rpmbuild past
   this point!

   Then insert the samba-vscan into the tree:
	cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/samba-2.2.7/examples/VFS
	bunzip < ~/samba-vscan-0.3.2.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

   and compile samba-vscan:
	cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/samba-2.2.7/examples/VFS/samba-vscan-0.3.2

   I'm using kaspersky4, which puts its libraries in a different place...
	cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/samba-2.2.7/examples/VFS/samba-vscan-0.3.2/kaspersky/
	mv Makefile Makefile.KAV3
	mv Makefile.KAV4 Makefile

   check the default settings
	cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/samba-2.2.7/examples/VFS/samba-vscan-0.3.2/kaspersky/
	vi vscan-kavp.h
		# defaults look good

   build it!
	make

   install it!
	make install

	# NOTE: the settings in vscan-kavp.conf should be the same as
	# when vscan-kavp.h is initially delivered to you, and will
	# override those defaults!  so it may be better to just edit these
	# and just not mess with the .h files
	cp vscan-kavp.conf /etc/samba/vscan-kavp.conf

    NOTE: If you do not want to use the global lib, you may use the
    buildin libraray. Simply do

    ./configure --with-libkavdc-builtin=yes
    make

    Normally, configure should autodected it (i.e. if no global lib
    is available, the buildin lib will be used).  
 
- mks_vir Daemon
  You need mks32 - virus scanner, mksd - daemon for mks32, and virus
  signatures for mks32 from http://download.mks.com.pl/download/
  (i.e. mksLinux-x-y-z.tgz, mksdLinux-x.yy.tgz, bazy3.tgz).
  All README and INSTALL files are in Polish language, so full
  instruction is below.
  Install mks32 and mksd, i.e.
  
  mkdir /usr/local/lib/mks
  cd /usr/local/lib/mks
  tar xzf <path>/mksLinux-x-y-z.tgz
  tar xzf <path>/mksdLinux-x.yy.tgz
  tar xzf <path>/bazy3.tgz
  ln -s mksd-x.yy/mksd .
  
  Edit /etc/mks_vir.cfg, add:
  
  --mks-vir-dat-path=/usr/local/lib/mks/bazy3/
  --scan
  
  Make directory for mksd socket and mksd.pid:
  
  mkdir /var/run/mksd
  
  Run mksd:
  
  /usr/local/lib/mks/mksd
  or:
  /usr/local/lib/mks/mksd [scan|cure] [number_of_processes]

  Install libmksd.a:
  cd /usr/local/lib/mks/mksd-x.yy/inne
  tar xf src.tar
  make
  cp libmksd.a /usr/local/lib
  cp libmksd.h /usr/local/include
  
  And then build the mks module as usual by simply typing "make".

  NOTE: In any case, the method above is not possible (i.e you're the
  package maintainer of a RPM package or a *BSD port) or you do not
  want to install the library globally, as mentioned above, simply do
  the following steps

  ./configure --with-libmksd-builtin=yes
  make

  (Note: configure should auto-detect this)

  Then the libmksd library (mks/libmksd) will be build and used 
  instead (licensed LGPL).
  But as this builtin library may not be up-to-date, this is not the preferred 
  way.


- OpenAntiVirus ScannerDaemon
  A running ScannerDaemon on the same host as your Samba Server is needed. Per
  default, localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 8127 is assumed. The port can be
  changed via VSCAN_OAV_PORT in vscan-oav.h or via the oav port = <int>
  setting in the run-time configuration file.


- Sophos Sweep via Sophie / Trend via Trophie
  You need Sophie or Trophie from http://www.vanja.com/tools/. As socket name
  /var/run/sophie (/var/run/trophie) is assumed. You can modify this via
  SOPHIE_SOCKET_NAME (TROPHIE_SOCKET_NAME) in vscan-sophos.h (vscan-trend.h) or
  via sophie socket name = <string> (trophie socket name = <string>) in the
  run-time configuration file.
  The socket must have read/write permissions for everyone (i.e. 
  chmod a+rw /var/run/sophie) , as smbd runs under various user IDs (i.e. 
  "nobody" or as the user "xyz", when user "xyz" is connected to his home 
  directory). This could be a security risk, as now an attacker could pass 
  arbitrary commands to Sophie/Trophie, so we need a better solution here ... 


- Clam AntiVirus Daemon
  You need Clam AntiVirus Daemon from http://www.clamav.org/. As socket name
  /var/run/clamd is assumed. You can modify this via CLAMD_SOCKET_NAME
  in vscan-clamav.h or via clamd socket name = <string> in the run-time
  configuration file.
  The socket must have read/write permissions for everyone (i.e. 
  chmod a+rw /var/run/clamd), as smbd runs under various user IDs (i.e. 
  "nobody" or as the user "xyz", when user "xyz" is connected to his home 
  directory). This could be a security risk, as now an attacker could pass 
  arbitrary commands to Clam AntiVirus Daemon, so we need a better
  solution here ... 


Check the license of your anti-virus product
-------------------------------------------

Before using samba-vscan together with your anti-virus product, please check
if your current license allows this, i.e. are you allowed to use it on a
server? Are you allowed to use it for your (maximum) number of users connected
to your Samba Server? Contains the license some other stuff, which won't
permit it to use within samba-vscan? If in doubt, please contact your
vendor/dealer and buy the correct license. Thank you very much for your
co-operation.


Subscribe to mailing list
-------------------------

Every user of samba-vscan is encouraged to subscribe at least to
the openantivirus-announce mailing list. Via this list we announce
new versions, security announcements and other news. It's a low
volume list.

Please see http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=10590 for all
available mailing list and for subscription details. 


How to report bugs, give feedback or send patches
-------------------------------------------------

Please send a mail to Rainer Link <rainer@openantivirus.org>. If you think
your input is valuable for others, you may of course post to the 
openantivirus-discuss mailing list. If it's a technical issue, you
may post to openantivirus-developer mailing list.

Security issues should reported only to me directly. Please use my 
PGP-Key (ID: 13B44079) for privacy. 

To report bugs or send patches you may use the SF Tracker, if you like
(http://sf.net/projects/openantivirus). I prefer patches in unified diff
format (diff -u), as there are more human readable (at least for me).
