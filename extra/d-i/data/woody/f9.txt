0fhttp://www.debian.org/07, follow the link labeled 0fMailing List
Subscription07 to see an overview of the 80+ lists associated with The
Debian Project.  A convenient subscription form is available on the
0fMailing List Subscription07 web page.

If you know the name of list you are interested in, you can subscribe manually
by sending an e-mail message to 0fdebian-<listname>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org07
containing the word "0fsubscribe07".  Communication with other subscribers to
the list is through the 0fdebian-<listname>@lists.debian.org07 e-mail address.
Where <listname> is replaced with the name of the e-mail list of interest.

For example, if you wish to report a problem or need help with installation
of Debian packages: send the word "0fsubscribe07" in a message to
0fdebian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org07; then send a detailed explanation
of your problem to 0fdebian-user@lists.debian.org07.  Your message will be
read by hundreds of Debian users, and someone will be sure to help.
