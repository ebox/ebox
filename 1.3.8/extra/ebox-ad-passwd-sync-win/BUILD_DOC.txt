How to do it
------------

A VC++ workspace is provied, you only have to open it and build the
passwdhk and ebox_adsync_config projects in Release mode
(select them one by one in Build --> Set Active Configuration).
The remaining passwdhk_driver project is not needed.

Then, there is a make_installer.bat script that does the rest. The required
software components have to be installed previously to that.
