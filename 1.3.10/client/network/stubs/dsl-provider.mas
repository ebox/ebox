# Configuration file for PPP, using PPP over Ethernet
# to connect to a DSL provider.
#
# See the manual page pppd(8) for information on all the options.

##
# Section 1
#
# Stuff to configure...

# MUST CHANGE: Uncomment the following line, replacing the user@provider.net
# by the DSL user name given to your by your DSL provider.
# (There should be a matching entry in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets with the password.)
user <% $ppp_user %>

# Use the pppoe program to send the ppp packets over the Ethernet link
# This line should work fine if this computer is the only one accessing
# the Internet through this DSL connection. This is the right line to use
# for most people.
#pty "/usr/sbin/pppoe -I eth0 -T 80 -m 1452"

# An even more conservative version of the previous line, if things
# don't work using -m 1452...
#pty "/usr/sbin/pppoe -I eth0 -T 80 -m 1412"

# If the computer connected to the Internet using pppoe is not being used
# by other computers as a gateway to the Internet, you can try the following
# line instead, for a small gain in speed:
#pty "/usr/sbin/pppoe -I eth0 -T 80"


# The following two options should work fine for most DSL users.

# Assumes that your IP address is allocated dynamically
# by your DSL provider...
noipdefault
# Try to get the name server addresses from the ISP.
usepeerdns
# Use this connection as the default route.
# Comment out if you already have the correct default route installed.
defaultroute

##
# Section 2
#
# Uncomment if your DSL provider charges by minute connected
# and you want to use demand-dialing.
#
# Disconnect after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of idle time.

#demand
#idle 300

##
# Section 3
#
# You shouldn't need to change these options...
