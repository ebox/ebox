samba-vscan - on-access virus scanning with Samba 2.2.x/3.0
***********************************************************

[Introduction]
samba-vscan currently consists of twelve Samba VFS modules:

* vscan-antivir - for use with H+BEDV AntiVir (server version)
* vscan-fprotd - for use with F-Prot Daemon
* vscan-icap - for use with an ICAP anti-virus service, currently only
  Symantec AntiVirus Engine 4.x is supported (this is alpha code and not
  yet for production environment!)
* vscan-kavp - for use with Kaspersky AntiVirus (kavdaemon) via
  Kaspersky KAV client C library. vscan-kavp is a stripped-down version
  from vscan-kavp of  Ries van Twisk). For the full-featured version please
  see http://www.rvt.dds.nl
* vscan-mks - for use with mks32 via mks_vir Daemon
* vscan-oav - for use with OpenAntiVirus.org ScannerDaemon
* vscan-sophos - for use with Sophos Sweep via Sophie 
  (http://www.vanja.com/tools) 
* vscan-trend - for use with Trend Micro FileScanner / InterScan VirusWall
  via Trophie (http://www.vanja.com/tools) 
* vscan-clamav - for use with Clam AntiVirus Daemon (clamd) or libclamav
  (http://www.clamav.net)
* vscan-nai - for use with NAI/McAfee uvscan
* vsan-fsav - for use with F-Secure AntiVirus (daemon)
* vscan-symantec - for use with Symantec Anti Virus Engine
  Note: the vscan-symantec module will statically linked against
  the symantec library. This lib is not covered by GPL and the
  resulting vscan-symantec VFS module may infringe the GPL of
  Samba! Due this reason, the vscan-symantec module will only be
  build if --with-symantec flag is used for ./configure



For installation instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.
It's basically a proof-of-concept module for providing on-access virus 
scanning with Samba.

NOTE: To get VFS support on FreeBSD systems, you'll have to apply the
samba-configure.in-fbsd-libdl.dif (at least for Samba 2.2.0-2.2.3)


For an introduction about the Samba Virtual File System, please read
http://www.geocities.com/orville_torpid/papers/vfs_tutorial.html.
For more details, please see the Samba source (esp. source/smbd and
examples/VFS). The samba/samba-technical ML archive is a good source
of information, too. The Samba Developers Guide of Samba 3.x is worth
a reading as well.


[Credits]
I'd like to thank Tim Potter, REYNAUD Jean-Samuel, Simon Harrison
and the whole Samba Team. Last but not least all the cool people at SuSE and
my OpenAntiVirus.org crew ;) Thanks to Adrian Woizik for providing me
access to his FreeBSD machine. 


[History]
In mid-May 2001 I started to dig into the VFS stuff (mostly at night ;)) and 
some days later I got the audit example really working (it didn't work 
out-of-the-box). As I was working on the Sophie integration into AMaViS,
I've decided to use Sophie with my virus scanning VFS module, too.
samba-vscan was released to the public on 10/03/2001 by checking in the
sources into the CVS repository of OpenAntiVirus.org
