- To install this module you need to install EBox base and squid before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Update your sudoers file with the ebox-sudoers command.

- Do not run squid on startup, this module takes control of squid:

mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXsquid /etc/rc2.d/K20squid

- Stop squid if it's running.
