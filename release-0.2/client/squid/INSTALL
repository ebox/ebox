- To install this module you need to install EBox base before.

- Once EBox base has been installed:
	
	./configure
	make install

  configure will autodetect EBox base path to install

- Make sure the apache user is able to write  /etc/squid.conf

- Do not run squid on startup, this module takes control of squid:

mv /etc/rc2.d/SXXsquid /etc/rc2.d/K20squid

- Stop squid if it's running.

- Make sure the apache user can write in the ebox localstatedir (the are new
  files in that directory now):

  chown -R www-data.www-data $localstatedir/ebox/
