                  0fWelcome to 0bDebian GNU/Linux 3.00f!07

This is a Debian CD-ROM.  Keep it available once you have installed
your system, as you can boot from it to repair the system on your hard
disk if that ever becomes necessary (press <09F307> for details).

For a "safe" installation with kernel 2.2.20, you can press <09ENTER07> to begin.
If you want additional features like modern hardware support, specify a
different boot flavor at the boot prompt (press <09F307> to get an overview). 
If you run into trouble or if you already have questions, press <09F107>
for quick installation help.

0fWARNING07: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
    proceeding.  The installation procedure can completely and 0cirreversibly07
    erase them!  If you haven't made backups yet, remove the CD-ROM
    from the drive and press <09RESET07> or <09Control-Alt-Del07> to get back to
    your old system.
